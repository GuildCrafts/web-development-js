# Craft: Web Development with JavaScript

This repository stores information useful for learning the craft of web development and primarily serves as our goal library.

This is a shared resource, and it is collaboratively developed by all learners. To learn how to contribute, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). You'll need to download the version of Ruby specified in `./.ruby-version` to get the app running.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to start the server at `http://localhost:4000`
4. Make any changes and review your results

## Contents

### Goals

This repo is the home to our goal library. Goals are stored as files in the [_goals/](./_goals) directory.

You can create new goals! Before you do so, please review the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), especially the [Authoring Goals](CONTRIBUTING.md#authoring-goals) section. Use the [contract template][goal-template] to author your new contract.

If you don't have time to author a new goal, but you still think it should be a part of the goal library, please **make a goal suggestion** by submitting a [new issue][repo-issues]. Read the [Suggesting Goals](CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-goals) section of the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn more.

### Playlists

Playlists are possible paths to becoming a full-stack JavaScript web developer. They are collections of learning contracts organized by other learners to provide meaningful courses of learning.

All playlists are stored in the [playlists](./playlists) directory.

This directory is a collection of trails intended to help travelers in making their own. There are as many paths as there are people aspiring to become one. Ultimately, every aspiring developer must learn to navigate the terrain on their own terms and create their own path if they are to become life long learners.

To author your own playlist, submit a pull request your playlists added to the [playlists](./playlists) directory. To make suggestions/updates to an existing playlist, submit a pull request, and tag the playlist's owner.
