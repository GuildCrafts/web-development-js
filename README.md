### Guides

[Guides](./guides) are a place to share wisdom on a particular skill related to web development.

For example, you might find a guide on "Architecting RESTful Web Services" or "Design Patterns for ECMAScript 2015".

If you want to contribute a guide, create a new file on your own branch using the [TEMPLATE.md][guide-template] and write your guide. Follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you would like to make edits to improve a guide, that's fantastic! Use the process outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and when you submit your pull request make sure to `@` mention the author of the guide so that they have an opportunity to chime in before the changes get made.

### Library

For example, you might find links in here to great instructional videos, open-source books, or free tutorials.

You can add library items just like you would add a guide (but with the [library template][library-template]), with the added caveat that the resource you add must have appropriate licensing for sharing within this service. Private and/or paid resources like Udemy courses or paywall-blocked tutorials are not allowed for legal reasons.
