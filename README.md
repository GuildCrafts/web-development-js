# Craft: Web Development with JavaScript

This repository stores information useful for learning the craft of web development.

It is home to our goal library, a reference for key resources, and a place to share best practices.

This is a shared resource, and it is collaboratively developed by all learners. To learn how to contribute, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contents

### Goals and Contracts

This repo is the home to our Goal Library.

Goals are stored as [issues][repo-issues], and all goals have an associated learning contract in the [contracts](./contracts) directory.

You can create new goals! Before you do so, please review the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), especially the [Authoring Goals](CONTRIBUTING.md#authoring-goals) section. Use the [contract template][contract-template] to author your new contract.

If you don't have time to author a new goal, but you still think it should be a part of the goal library, please **make a goal suggestion** by submitting a [new issue][repo-issues]. Read the [Suggesting Goals](CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-goals) section of the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn more.

### Playlists

Playlists are possible paths to becoming a full-stack JavaScript web developer. They are collections of learning contracts organized by other learners to provide meaningful courses of learning.

All playlists are stored in the [playlists](./playlists) directory.

This directory is a collection of trails intended to help travelers in making their own. There are as many paths as there are people aspiring to become one. Ultimately, every aspiring developer must learn to navigate the terrain on their own terms and create their own path if they are to become life long learners.

To author your own playlist, submit a pull request your playlists added to the [playlists](./playlists) directory. To make suggestions/updates to an existing playlist, submit a pull request, and tag the playlist's owner.

### Guides

[Guides](./guides) are a place to share wisdom on a particular skill related to web development.

For example, you might find a guide on "Architecting RESTful Web Services" or "Design Patterns for ECMAScript 2015".

If you want to contribute a guide, create a new file on your own branch using the [TEMPLATE.md][guide-template] and write your guide. Follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you would like to make edits to improve a guide, that's fantastic! Use the process outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and when you submit your pull request make sure to `@` mention the author of the guide so that they have an opportunity to chime in before the changes get made.

### Library

The [library](./library) is a set of external resources that are useful for learning this craft.

For example, you might find links in here to great instructional videos, open-source books, or free tutorials.

You can add library items just like you would add a guide (but with the [library template][library-template]), with the added caveat that the resource you add must have appropriate licensing for sharing within this service. Private and/or paid resources like Udemy courses or paywall-blocked tutorials are not allowed for legal reasons.
