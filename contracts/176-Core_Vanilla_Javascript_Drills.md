## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Are just beginning to write correct JavaScript and understand its syntax
- Are just getting started reading and writing JavaScript control structures, basic functions, and data types

## Description

A day-by-day structured set of challenges to be completed in team.
Last 2 days is a final project that demands/develops all your javascript foundation skills and stretches problem solving skills.

Fork the the [core-vanilla-javascript repository][core-vjs] and use the fork as your project artifact.

In the [README.md][core-vjs-readme] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace, or faster to get the most out of it.

## Context

Becoming a full stack web developer means that you need to be comfortable with the core language first, before using it in the web stack.
