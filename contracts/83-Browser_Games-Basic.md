# Browser Games [Basic]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can build basic web sites with HTML & CSS
- Can add behavior to a web site with JavaScript
- Are familiar with DOM manipulation
- Are familiar with games like tic-tac-toe and Simon
- Are interested in making more complex interactive web pages

## Description

Build simple graphical games for the browser.

Fork the the [browser-games repository][browser-games] and use the fork as your project artifact.

Implement the games **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Simon** from the list in the [games.md][games-list] file.

You will be using FreeCodeCamp challenges as guides and tutorials for building these games.

## Context

This goal will challenge your ability to take a _formal, defined system_ from the real world and replicate it in code. You will start with all of the logic of the system (the rules of the game) and most of the UI already designed.

Your work will be mainly in deciding how to replicate that formal logic and user interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
