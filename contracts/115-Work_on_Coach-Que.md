# Work on Coach-Que : Schedule Time & Incorporate Feedback

Build a tool for learners to schedule time with coaches at Learners Guild.

The tool will also help learners and coaches to give feedback on the time spent together.

Coach-Que is an ongoing project. You will be working in a [living codebase](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/coach-que/commits/master) on [real issues](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/coach-que/issues) with [other developers](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/coach-que/graphs/contributors).

When you join Coach-Que, you will select or be assigned issues to work on for the week. Be ready to jump in and contribute!
