# Work on Coach-Que : Schedule Time & Incorporate Feedback

Build a tool for learners to schedule time with coaches at Learners Guild.

The tool will also help learners and coaches to give feedback on the time spent together.

Coach-Que is an ongoing project. You will be working in a live codebase on real issues with other developers.

When you join Coach-Que, you will select or be assigned issues to work on for the week. Be ready to jump in and contribute!
