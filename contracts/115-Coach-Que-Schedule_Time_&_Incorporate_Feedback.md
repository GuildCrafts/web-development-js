# Coach-Que : Schedule Time & Incorporate Feedback

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a new service which integrates with Echo chat.  This service/tool will be used by learners to schedule time with coaches at Learners Guild. The tool will also help learners and coaches to give feedback on the time spent together.
