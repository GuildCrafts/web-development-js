# Exercises: Foundational Relational Database Knowledge

## Description

**SQL Foundations**

Learn SQL query fundamentals by working through bite-sized tutorials on [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) and [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/). Execute tutorial queries directly on [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) and [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/) to yield the desired data.

**SQL Foundations Practice Exercises**

Once you gain more confidence in your ability to construct queries with tutorial data, start working through database exercises on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/).

**Exercises to Reinforce Conceptual Knowledge**

To solidify your conceptual knowledge of databases, visit [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/databases/relational-algebra) to build foundational knowledge for working with relational databases. These challenges also expose you to non-relational/NoSQL databases as well as the theoretical underpinnings of relational databases.

Work on a subset of "Easy" and "Medium" level problems in different domains, including:
- Relational Algebra
- Database Normalization
- SQL query construction  

Run your responses against the automated test suites provided by LeetCode and HackerRank while using SQL reference materials to construct your answers.
## Context

Foundational knowledge for working with relational databases is important if you are creating or maintaining web applications with persistent storage. Sometimes to overhead of learning how to use a new SQL client or a library (for example, the [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise), or the [KnexJS](http://knexjs.org/) query builder) detracts from learning these foundational concepts. 

This project provides the opportunity to focus on this core knowledge so working with SQL clients and ORMs will be easier in a 'real-world' environment.

The exercises to reinforce conceptual knowledge emphasize the importance of knowing how to make solid DB design decisions. Being able to write SQL queries is an important skill, but being able to design a schema that minimizes redundancy and maximizes reliable and painless access to data will pay dividends.
