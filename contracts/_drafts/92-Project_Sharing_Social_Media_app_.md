# Project Sharing Social Media app 

## Description

_The basic idea of this goal is that users are able to share resources with each other through project sharing. For example, a friend of mine works for the ACLU and they are working on a mobile app where users can send video and detailed information if they see police brutality happening. Organizations like Open Oakland [Open Oakland](https://www.openoakland.org/projects/) have a project similar to this goal except this project includes authentication and will have a much better UI üëç 
Here is a prototype I built.

[Justice For Us Project Page](http://justice-for-us.com/projects.html)

I built this project with a Node, MongoDB, and Express back end. You can conceivably use any stack that includes a database a server and front end framework.
## Context

This project will help solidify your knowledge on databases and data relationships. Think bookstore but using projects and creating relationships between users. Piping data bi-directionally from the front to the back and vice versa. You will also get experience using a geolocating API because data will need to be located on a map.
## Specifications
- [ ] As a user I can sign up, log in, and log out into the app
- [ ] Mobile First Design
- [ ] As a logged in user, I can view all of my friend's projects on a map and the project information will also be displayed on the page
- [ ] As a logged in user, I can search for projects within a certain address or zip code
- [ ] As a logged in user, I can create a new project and it will be added to the database
- [ ] As a logged in user, I can edit a new project and it will be updated in the database
- [ ] As a logged in user, I can delete a new project and it will be destroyed in the database
### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Quality Rubric

_What are some appropriate quality objectives for this goal? These are statements about the internal characteristics of the product that demonstrate fine design and craftspersonship, not its external features._
- Quality rubric one: - Team follows good git behavior 25 points
- Quality rubric two: Code is refactored and is not repeated in other parts of the program 25 points
- Quality rubric three: User Interface is well designed 25 points
