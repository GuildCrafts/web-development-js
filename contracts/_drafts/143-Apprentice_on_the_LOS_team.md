# Apprentice on the LOS team

## Description

Under the direction of one of the LOS Software Engineers, work on features or bugfixes from the backlog.

You will need to get the LOS apps running locally if you haven't already.

* https://github.com/LearnersGuild/idm
* https://github.com/LearnersGuild/game
* https://github.com/LearnersGuild/graphiql

Follow the instructions in the README for each repo, starting with [IDM](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/idm)

## Context

This is the real deal. You'll be working on real issues that really need to ship on a real app with real users. You'll be doing a mix of pairing with your team and doing cognitive apprenticeship with one of the LOS Software Engineers.

## Specifications

Specifications and requirements will come from LOS story tickets in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/learnersguild/) (the LOS issue tracking system).
