# Work on Goalie

## Description

**Goalie** is a better goal library for the LOS. It is an ongoing, maintained `prototype` project that will have a deployed, live alpha version usable by current learners.

Goalie uses GitHub issues as its canonical data store, wrapping the issue data and providing a more useful/relevant interface to the LOS goals.

Check the repo for more information. https://github.com/GuildCrafts/goalie

## Context

This is not a drill. Working on Goalie means that you'll be deploying code to a live server with real users. Performance, error handling, and UX will be of primary concern.

If you choose this goal, you will take on tasks like:

- Configuring and managing a production deployment
- Administering databases in multiple environments
- Analyzing performance and debugging with professional monitoring software
- Tracking and resolving user-submitted bug reports and feature requests
- Converting UI/UX design specs into high-quality code

It will be challenging. If this is your first time working on a live product with real users, you will be stretched. It will be fun.

## Specifications
