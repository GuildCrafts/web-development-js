# Create a Simple Shopping Cart application with React.js 

## Description

Based off of this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-simple-shopping-cart-with-react-js-and-flux

Want to learn how to create a basic shopping cart application? Want to learn how to use react.js? Then this goal is for you! 
## Context

This goal is important because react is cool to learn. But don't just listen to me, read these quotes from the following leaders in the industry:

Quotes about React.js

"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created and open-sourced by Facebook. It was first released in 2013, and its original slogan was, “Rethinking best practices.” Why? Because the most well-known JavaScript frameworks (i.e., Ember.js and AngularJS) at the time based their architecture on the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern, which largely focuses on separating the application logic from the view.

But the team behind React thought they had a better idea. Instead of completely separating the application logic from the view, it coupled the logic and view into one file using something called the component-based architecture, which allowed the composition of these components.

The programming community was initially a bit confused by this approach and didn’t seem to take to it. Now fast-forward to today: Both Ember and Angular, as well as some newer frameworks and view libraries, have moved toward a component-based architecture — even coupling some of the logic and the view code in the same file like React." - _[Code School Blog](https://www.codeschool.com/blog/2016/04/19/why-learn-react/), 4/19/2016_

"React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

We built React to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time."
