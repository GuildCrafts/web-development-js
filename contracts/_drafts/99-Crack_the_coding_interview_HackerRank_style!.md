# Crack the coding interview HackerRank style!

## Description

HackerRank recently introduced a module called [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview/status/all/page/1). For those thinking about delving more deeply into the algorithms and data structures concepts they've missed out on, this challenge is for you. 

You will choose one of two tracks: **Depth** or **Breadth**, each with its own set of specifications. 

**Depth** focuses on gaining a deep knowledge of a particular category of algorithms (e.g., sorting algorithms) or data structures (e.g., binary trees).

**Breadth** provides a gentle introduction to several different algorithms and data structures concepts.  

For each HackerRank question you complete, you will run your solution against an automated test suite that will determine if you've sufficiently solved the problem, or need to tweak your code to match the question's original specification and any edge cases that accompany it.
## Context

Learning these concepts is core to passing the 'traditional' tech interview.

Learning these concepts is also a good way to reinforce the CS theory behind the data structures, algorithms and libraries you may encounter while working on your programming goals.

Rely on the videos that accompany each challenge to understand the core concepts necessary to solve the problems. It's important to develop a sense of independence while approaching these problems, though please be sure ask for help if you have exhausted the resources available to you. 

The reason developing this independence is important is because in an interview, assistance will be less free flowing than it is at LG. :)
## Specifications

**Breadth:**
- [ ] Solve the 4 Easy challenges and 3 Medium challenges under the "Data Structures" section: 
  
  **Easy (solve all):**

  [Strings: Making Anagrams](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-making-anagrams)
  [Hash Tables: Ransom Note](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ransom-note)
  [Linked Lists: Detect a Cycle](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-linked-list-cycle)
  
  **Medium (solve all):**
  [Stacks: Balanced Brackets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-balanced-brackets)
  [Queues: A Tale of Two Stacks](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-queue-using-two-stacks)
  [Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree)
- [ ] Solve 2 out of the 3 Medium challenges under the "Algorithms" section
  
  **Medium (solve 2):**
  [Sorting: Bubble Sort](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort)
  [Sorting: Comparator](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-comparator-sorting)
  [Binary Search: Ice Cream Parlor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor)
- [ ] Solve the 2 Easy challenges under the "Techniques/Concepts" section and 1 out of 2 Medium Challenges
  
  **Easy (solve all):**
  [Recursion: Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-fibonacci-numbers)
  [Bit Manipulation: Lonely Integer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-lonely-integer)
  
  **Medium (solve 1):**
  [Time Complexity: Primality](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-big-o)
  [Recursion: Davis' Staircase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-recursive-staircase)

**Depth:**
- [ ] Choose one of the following subdomains in HackerRank's [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup) domain, and solve 10 problems within each domain:
  
  [Strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/strings/difficulty/all/page/1)
  [Sorting](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/arrays-and-sorting/difficulty/all/page/1)
  [Search](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/search/difficulty/all/page/1)
  [Graph Theory](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/graph-theory/difficulty/all/page/1)
  [Greedy](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/greedy/difficulty/all/page/1)
  [Dynamic Programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/dynamic-programming/difficulty/all/page/1)
  
  NOTE: there are no "easy" Dynamic Programming problems, at least according to HackerRank. :p
- [ ] Provide a working implementation of the data structure of your choice. The implementation should support the following operations: `insert()` / `add()`, `remove()` / `delete()`, and `find()` (bonus points if you implement additional operations). 
- [ ] Solve 6 HackerRank or LeetCode challenges that test your ability to use the data structure you chose above. If the HackerRank or LeetCode links do not contain 6 challenges, use the data structure to solve another challenge you find on HackerRank or somewhere else on the internets. 
  
  Choose from the following:
  
    [Dynamically-sized list](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/arrays)
    [Linked List](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/linked-lists)
    [Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trees)
    [Binary Search Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trees/difficulty/all/page/1)
    [Balanced Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/balanced-trees)
    [Stack](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/stacks)
    [Queue](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/queues)
    [Heap](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/heap)
    [Trie](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trie) and [Trie (LeetCode)](https://leetcode.com/tag/trie/)
    [Graph (LeetCode)](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/)

Feel free to substitute any one challenge for a challenge of a higher difficulty level.
