# Test Drive Bookstore

## Description

You'll be starting from this repo https://github.com/GuildCrafts/tdd-bookstore

Your task will be to, simply, make all the tests pass. 

You'll be building a bookstore like API driven entirely by the tests! :D

## Context

It is important to be able to read tests and make code that satisfies those specifications. This is a version of the Bookstore API tested by Mocha. 

## Specifications

- [ ] Make all the tests pass
- [ ] Persist your data somewhere (probably a database)
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

## Quality Rubric

_What are some appropriate quality objectives for this goal? These are statements about the internal characteristics of the product that demonstrate fine design and craftspersonship, not its external features._

- All the tests pass: 100
- The `/test` directory was not modified: 100
- Your routes are broken up into multiple files: 20
- You use different databased depending on `process.env.NODE_ENV`: 20
