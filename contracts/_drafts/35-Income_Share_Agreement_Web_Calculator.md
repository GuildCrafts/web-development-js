# Income Share Agreement Web Calculator

## Description

Create an online calculator that allows a prospective Learners Guild applicant to determine various outcomes of opting in to the Income Share Agreement (ISA) and stipend. 

Customer: for deployment on Learnersguild.org
User: a prospective applicant
## Context

_Why is this goal important? How is it useful? What questions will it raise?_

This goal is important because it has an actual customer (Learners Guild) and actual users (prospective applicants). This is an opportunity to analyze and explore UX. How can one effectively, clearly, visually communicate these complex mathematical equations?

For many applicants, the concept of an ISA is new, and the details around how it works and the financial implications can be confusing. 

An example of a spreadsheet designed to run some of these calculations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGhQJeezQwfytiS-WJ4WC3G8TjDxn-ia59ko-bWcYJY/edit?usp=sharing). 

This calculator can help applicants make informed decisions around the ISA and Living Allowance. 
Changing variables, like salary and amount of stipend, can result in thousands of dollars of difference in the amount of tuition paid.
## Required Specs (Must Have)
- [ ] User can select variables (like income and stipend) with buttons or forms.
- [ ] User can define what their starting salary is
- [ ] User can define what their annual raise is
- [ ] User can specify how much stipend they want. For every 100 dollars in stipend their stipend percentage should go up 
- [ ] User should see their full amount paid back
- [ ] User should be able to adjust cost of capital percentage
- [ ] User should click on refresh button and have all output refreshed
- [ ] User should see their full amount paid back adjusted for cost of capital (which defaults to 8%)
- [ ] The app will display labeled variables (e.g. Starting Salary: $80,000)
- [ ] These labeled variables will be visually, linearly displayed to communicate the math being done
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Optional Specs (Nice To Have)
- [ ] The app is responsive and mobile-friendly.
- [ ] Calculator includes an annual raise variable that defaults to 5%
- [ ] The app compares ISA outcomes with upfront tuition.
- [ ] Variables will have (?) hover links to provide more background about the components of the ISA and stipend.
- [ ] Team has interviewed at least three potential users about features and UX.
- [ ] Auto update
- [ ] Save the sheet
- [ ] Print out report
- [ ] Uses same UI elements + Bootstrap theme of Learnersguild.org (link will be provided)
