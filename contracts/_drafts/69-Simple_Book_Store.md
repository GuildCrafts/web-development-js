# Simple Book Store

## Description

Create a simple content management system that allows users to add, delete, or update books.  Books entered in the system can be viewed in a listing, or searched for using basic searches (title, author, genre). 

## Context

- [ ] Users can search for books by title OR by author OR by genre, and search results will be presented in a new page
- [ ] Users can view book details on a book detail page, linked to from the listing or search pages
- [ ] All code submissions are peer reviewed via GitHub PR by at least two members of the team, and master is always in a stable state (tests passed, site functions)
### Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
