# Learners Guild Momentum

## Description

The goal is to produce something similar to the [Momentum extension](https://momentumdash.com/), which appears to be popular around Learners Guild. The text that displays can then be focused on Learners Guild activities, culture tensions, and more. For example, every Friday, users might get a message asking them if they're thinking about project reviews or retrospective. Quotations at the bottom of the page can be from LG staff or other Learners or guest speakers or any other relevant person (with the quoted person's permission, of course).
## Context

Momentum has an attractive UI that should be fun for front end focused people to take on over the course of a week. A developer will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front end, and will use an API in order to have ever changing photos. There will also be a back end! (which I will ask LG staff for help developing). There are many features of this extension that can be duplicated and refined to be specific for LG, so specs can be easily modified.
