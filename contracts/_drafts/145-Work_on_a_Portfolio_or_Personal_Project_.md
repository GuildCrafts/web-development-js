# Work on a Portfolio or Personal Project 

Create and deploy two personal portfolio sites showcasing your work as developers, one for each team member.

You'll be responsible for managing time such that both sites are completed.

This project will allow you to deepen in:
- Wireframing
- Creating a full-stack website from scratch
- Deployment
