# Simple Book Store + Google Sheets

# Simple Book Store + Google Sheets

This is a clone of [Simple Book Store](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/69) except you are going to be using google sheets as your database.

Use one or some of [the NPM modules available to help you talk to the google docs API](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=google+sheets) to create a bookstore app that stores all of its data in a google sheets document. Either use multiple docs or one doc with multiple sheets. Preferable the latter. Think of each sheet as a table in a relational database. Each sheet has columns and rows just like SQL.
