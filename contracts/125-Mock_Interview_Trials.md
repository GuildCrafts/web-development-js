# Mock Interview Trials

## Description

_Provide a brief, high-level overview of what the final product (artifact) of this goal is. Include any relevant resources or dependencies here._

Practice your interviewing skills with mock interview trials.

Fork the [interview-trials][interview-trials] repository and use the fork as your project artifact.

To complete this goal, each team member should conduct at least two interview trials with an interviewer. The rest of the time should be spent preparing for interviews and practicing common interview questions.

At the end of the project, submit the trial files for each interview conducted, along with the questions used, the interviewee reflection, and the interviewer's evaluation.

It is up to the interviewer to decide how they wish to conduct their interviews, but they should all use the same evaluation format provided in the repository.

## Context

_Why is this goal important? How is it useful? What questions will it raise?_

Unfortunately, just being good at building software with a team is not enough to get hired as a software developer. The job interview is its own thing.

If you want to get a job, you'll need to _also_ be good at interviewing. This will mean different things for different companies, positions, and interviewers. There is no one question that they all ask, or one skill that they all look for.

As a result, the best way to prepare is to do "mock" interviews as a trial, with plenty of feedback from the interviewer. Not only will this give you practice answering questions and solving problems in an interview setting, but it will also help to demystify the interview process.
