# Learner's Toolbox

## Description

You will be an app for storing and displaying a list of the best coding resources that learner's have found. The UI should be intuitive and the user should be able to search for specific types of resources(i.e React, Pug, etc.). It would be ideal for the app to utilize the idm service and allow users to login with their github information. There should also be a process to submit resources.

## Context

The guild is in need of a single place where learner's can find resources, tutorials, etc. And the most efficient thing to do is to create our own. You will be gathering information from other learner's, either through direct communication or echo. All resources will be compiled into a neat, easy to browse format, built for scaling. This resource will be used guild-wide and hopefully grow with future iterations
