## Description

A day-by-day structured deep dive into the basics of JavaScript. Read articles, watch videos, complete lessons and exercises.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), books like [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net), and various video tutorials.

Fork the the [core-vanilla-javascript repository][core-vjs] and use the fork as your project artifact.

In the [solo_study.md][core-vjs-solo] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace or faster to get the most out of it.

## Context

Before getting started building web applications, it's important to get a grounding into the basics of programming and JavaScript. Becoming a full stack web developer means that you need to be comfortable with the core language first, before using it in the web stack.
