## Challenge Rating

## Description

A day-by-day structured set of challenges to be completed in team.

The final 2 days consist of a final project that demands and develops all your JavaScript foundational skills and stretches problem solving skills.

Fork the the [core-vanilla-javascript repository][core-vjs] and use the fork as your project artifact.

In the [team_practice.md][core-vjs-team] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace or faster to get the most out of it.

## Context

Before getting started building web applications, it's important to get a grounding into the basics of programming and JavaScript. Becoming a full stack web developer means that you need to be comfortable with the core language first, before using it in the web stack.

Choose this goal if you're just getting started with the basics of JavaScript and programming and want to gain a solid foothold. This will be an immersive, intensive, and highly structured study.
