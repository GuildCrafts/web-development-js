# Timeoff Snapshot Approver Epic

## What's a Snapshot Goal?

A Snapshot goal is based on a medium-to-large-sized repo that is "frozen" in time. It's meant to simulate the experience of developing a feature for an existing "live" open source project.
Use snapshot goals to learn about working with larger code bases, and getting a simulated experience of being in a live sprint to push a set of features across the finish line.
