One of the hardest things about learning to be a web developer is that there is just so much stuff to learn, the list keeps growing all the time.

What do you focus on? Which skills, technologies, languages, and buzzwords are the _most_ important for you to know, or at least be aware of?

A more succinct way to phrase the question is:

> What are the important competencies of a web developer?

This is not a trivial question, and [many][mdn-guide] [different][bento] [resources][js-is-sexy] purport to have the answer. You can spend weeks on the web analyzing the resources, making Venn diagrams of skills across the many intersecting duties of a web developer (programming, product design, version control, database admin, etc.).

With all of these competing opinions, you'll need the ability to focus on the most important competencies, and to de-prioritize second- or third-tier topics.

So, then, how do identify and discern those important competencies?

## Defining importance

If you think about it, the most _accurate_ answer to "what competencies do I need to be a web developer" is really "whichever ones are required to do your job". This is not a _satisfactory_ answer, because it doesn't help guide the learning that you need in order to obtain said job.

So, to make an inherently unanswerable question _more_ answerable, we could use probabilities. Understanding that every job will require different skills, and will also require a significant amount of _learning new skills on the job_, a more actionable answer to the above question might look like this:

> The most important competencies for a web developer are those that are (a) required by the highest percentage of prospective job openings and (b) allow for rapid and effective on-the-job learning.

In other words, if you were to tally up all of the "required skills" for every web developer job opening, the most important competencies are the ones that appear most frequently on that list. Granted, this assumes that job descriptions are an accurate portrayal of the skills required to do the job well, but that's a topic for another time.

The good news is that part (a) gives you a pretty straightforward list, on which you'll likely find "skills" or "competencies" like these:

- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Git (and/or another VCS like Mercurial or Subversion)
- Relational Databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
- Document-based Databases (e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB)

So that's a start.

Part (b) is a bit more nebulous and meta. How fast you can learn new skills depends on a lot of things, and most people talk about "having a firm grasp of the fundamentals" being a key indicator of future learning.

I'd also argue that good learning habits, emotional intelligence and self-awareness, emphasis on rational problem solving, and a dogged curiosity will be equally helpful as conceptual knowledge.

There's a shadow part (c) to this answer, which is that there are competencies required to _succeed in a programming job interview_, and these may or may not overlap with any of the competencies in parts (a) or (b). These are, of course, equally important because without them you won't make it through many interviews.

Luckily, the competencies that fall under part (c) and not under (a) or (b) have been [well][coding-interview-book] [documented][quora-coding-interview-questions] and are, generally speaking, easier to learn than something as large and multi-faceted as "relational databases".

## Establish a criteria for importance

With a better definition of what an important competency actually is, you can now build a method for finding focus.

As a decision-making aid, a criteria or rubric is a useful tool. The simplest form they can take is as a set of questions to ask of any given option, structured such that the answers provide some objective guidance to you.

For example, here's one simple rubric for deciding whether or not to read a technical book:

1. Does it cover a skill that is commonly cited in job openings I'm interested in?
1. Do respected members of the industry read and recommend this book?
1. Will I be better able to navigate job applications and interviews after having read it?

If the answers are "yes" to all of the above, then your time would likely be well spent. If they are mostly "no", then it might not.

Creating a criteria or rubric for parts (a) and (c) should be relatively straight-forward: you may have to do a little research to come up with the right questions, but the data is out there. Plus, if you ever need help clarifying, you can always ask a mentor or advanced practitioner for guidance.

A rubric for part (b) is more complicated to come up with. You have to think about things like "will this skill help me learn other, as yet unknown, additional skills on the job?".

One, but by no means the only, way to approach a rubric is to think about competency dependencies.

A common situation is that learning a JavaScript framework (like Angular, React, or Ember) _depends on_ the an ability to write JavaScript. You may be able to learn Angular without a full knowledge of the JavaScript language, but when you try to learn the next hot framework, you will have a harder time. This is the "focus on the fundamentals" bit: because more things depend on fundamentals (by definition, that's what a fundamental is), you should learn them.

You can go too far in this direction though. For example: while everything in web development ultimately depends on electrical circuits, you don't need to know anything about circuitry to be a decent web developer.

## Create a rich environment

The purpose of this guide is to help aspiring web developers find focus so that they can direct their efforts towards learning the most important skills.

If you follow the above suggestions, you will benefit from a greater confidence that what you are learning is actually going to help you establish a career in web development.

Beyond that, though, you'll need an environment that offers ample opportunities to actually _practice_ the most important competencies.

A library of goals for projects that help you discover, gain, and get feedback on the most important skills will keep you on the right track, so you can spend less time worrying about whether or not you're focusing on the right thing, and more time learning.

Good luck, and happy learning!
