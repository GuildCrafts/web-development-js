### 6: Where in the JSON?

```JavaScript
{
    "name": "William Shakespeare",
    "dead" : true,
    "works" : [
        {
            "name" : "Romeo and Juliet",
            "published" : 1591,
            "isAwesome" : true
        },
        {
            "name" : "Richard III",
            "published" : 1592,
            "isAwesome" : false
        }
    ],
    "favoriteSites" : [
        "tumblr",
        "4chan"
    ]
}
```

If you wish to find the name of the first play in the list of Shakespeare's works, the "path" to it would look like like this:

`works -> 0 -> name`

You would say that the value located at this path is "Romeo and Juliet". The value "tumblr" is located at:

`favoriteSites -> 2`

Your task is to find a user-provided key hidden in a JSON object.

You will be given a JSON object, and you will print out the search path that leads to the value "4chan". You are allowed to use any JSON parsing libraries that you want to.

**Input:**

JSON object.

**Output:**

The search path for the string in the format shown above (each element should be joined together with `->` between them.). Each element in the path will either be an integer (if indexing a list) or a string (if indexing an object).
