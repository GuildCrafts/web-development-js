### 1: Guess The Number

Write a program that will generate a number between 1 and 100. Your program will ask the user to guess the generated number.

When the user types a guess, the program should tell them if they won (the guess matched the computer's number), if their guess was higher than the number the computer generated, OR if the guess was lower than the number the computer generated. Terminate the program if the user types "exit".

### Strategy
console.log "enter a number"
variable to store user input
variable to store 1-100 array
function to compare input and array
message for user: higher/lower/winning!
  if else

if else in mocha tests?
