**GOAL SUGGESTION**

_Be as specific as you can in your suggestion: what should the goal output be, which technologies would be used, why is the goal important._

_Add your issue to the "Ideas & Suggestions" column of the [Goal Library](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/projects/1) project to have it considered for the library._
