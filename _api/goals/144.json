  "content": "# Coding Exercises\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm\n- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts\n- Have used pseudocode as an intermediary step in writing a program\n- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving\n\n## Description\n\nComplete JavaScript coding exercises from the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.\n\nThese exercises involve writing small, single-file programs to solve a fun puzzle or problem.\n\nThe exercises are designed to cover a wide range of basic concepts and get progressively more complex.\n\nWrite tests using the `assert` module in Node.js or whatever testing library you feel most comfortable with. Come up with your own inputs and outputs (using the example inputs and outputs as well) and try to test with as many (reasonable) edge cases as you can.\n\n## Context\n\nA solo goal like this one is an opportunity for you to \"self-assess\" and get a better sense of your current skill level. As you work through the exercises, note what is easy and what is hard for you.\n\n**Use a this goal to**:\n\n- Take a break from pairing\n- Get a sense of what you can accomplish by yourself\n- Work on flexing problem solving skills\n- Assess how much you've learned/grown as a developer\n\n**To get a proper self-assessment:**\n\n- Start from scratch\n- Don't look at other repos\n- Understand and write every line of code\n- Ask for coaching sessions\n\n## Specifications\n\n#### Exercises\n\nTests and correct implementations exist for the following exercises (it is recommended that you complete them in this order):\n\n- [ ] __30:__ 1. Scrab-Bag\n- [ ] __30:__ 2. String Indices\n- [ ] __30:__ 3. Fibonacci Bases\n- [ ] __30:__ 4. The Disemvowling\n- [ ] __30:__ 5. Where in the JSON?\n- [ ] __30:__ 6. Who Wants A Date?\n- [ ] __30:__ 7. Play it again, JavaScript!\n- [ ] __30:__ 8. Parens-B-Gone\n\n#### General\n\n- [ ] __5:__ Artifact produced is a fork of the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.\n- [ ] __10:__ Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] __10:__ All tests are passing.\n- [ ] __5:__ Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.\n- [ ] __10:__ All package dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.\n- [ ] __5:__ All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.\n- [ ] __5:__ Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.\n- [ ] __10:__ Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.\n- [ ] __10:__ Functions are small and serve a single purpose.\n- [ ] __5:__ The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n### Stretch\n\nTests and correct implementations exist for the following exercises (it is recommended that you complete them in this order):\n\n- [ ] __30:__ 1. Resolving Symlinks\n- [ ] __30:__ 2. Lairotcaf\n- [ ] __30:__ 3. String Me Along\n- [ ] __30:__ 4. Braille\n- [ ] __30:__ 5. String Permutations\n- [ ] __30:__ 6. Guess The Number\n- [ ] __30:__ 7.
