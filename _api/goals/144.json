  "content": "# 15 Coding Exercises\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm\n- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts\n- Have used pseudocode as an intermediary step in writing a program\n- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving\n\n## Description\n\nComplete 15 JavaScript coding exercises from the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.\n\nThese exercises involve writing small, single-file programs to solve a fun puzzle or problem.\n\nIn this goal, you'll be attempting to complete 15 exercises from [the list][readme].\n\nThe specs of this goal are designed to cover a wide range of basic concepts and get progressively more complex.\n\nWrite tests using the `assert` module in Node.js or whatever testing library you feel most comfortable with. Come up with your own inputs and outputs (using the example inputs and outputs as well) and try to test with as many (reasonable) edge cases as you can.\n\n## Context\n\n**Use a this goal to**:\n\n- Take a break from pairing\n- Get a sense of what you can accomplish by yourself\n- Work on flexing problem solving skills\n- Assess how much you've learned/grown as a developer\n\n**To get a proper self assessment:**\n\n- Start from scratch\n- Don't look at other repos\n- Understand and write every line of code\n- Ask for coaching sessions\n- Get frequent code reviews\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.\n- [ ] Tests and correct implementations exist for the following exercises (it is recommended that you complete them in this order):\n  - [ ] 1. Guess The Number\n  - [ ] 2. Scrab-Bag\n  - [ ] 3. String Indices\n  - [ ] 4. Fibonacci Bases\n  - [ ] 5. The Disemvowling\n  - [ ] 6. Where in the JSON?\n  - [ ] 7. Who Wants A Date?\n  - [ ] 8. Play it again, JavaScript!\n  - [ ] 9. Parens-B-Gone\n  - [ ] 10. Resolving Symlinks\n  - [ ] 11. Lairotcaf\n  - [ ] 12. String Me Along\n  - [ ] 13. Braille\n  - [ ] 14. String Permutations\n  - [ ] 15. Finite State Gate\n- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] All tests are passing.\n- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.\n- [ ] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.\n- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.\n- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.\n- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.\n- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[coding-exercises-js]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/coding-exercises-js\n[readme]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/coding-exercises-js/blob/master/README.md"
