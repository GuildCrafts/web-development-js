Come up with your own inputs and outputs (using the example inputs and outputs as well) and try to test with as many (reasonable) edge cases as you can.\n\n## Context\n\n**Use a this goal to**:\n\n- Take a break from pairing\n- Get a sense of what you can accomplish by yourself\n- Work on flexing problem solving skills\n- Assess how much you've learned/grown as a developer\n\n**To get a proper self assessment:**\n\n- Start from scratch\n- Don't look at other repos\n- Understand and write every line of code\n- Ask for coaching sessions\n- Get frequent code reviews\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.\n- [ ] Tests and correct implementations exist for the following exercises (it is recommended that you complete them in this order):\n  - [ ] 1. Guess The Number\n  - [ ] 2. Scrab-Bag\n  - [ ] 3. String Indices\n  - [ ] 4. Fibonacci Bases\n  - [ ] 5. The Disemvowling\n  - [ ] 6. Where in the JSON?\n  - [ ] 7. Who Wants A Date?\n  - [ ] 8. Play it again, JavaScript!\n  - [ ] 9. Parens-B-Gone\n  - [ ] 10. Resolving Symlinks\n  - [ ] 11. Lairotcaf\n  - [ ] 12. String Me Along\n  - [ ] 13. Braille\n  - [ ] 14. String Permutations\n  - [ ] 15. Finite State Gate\n- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] All tests are passing.\n\n### Required\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Well formatted code**\n- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]\n- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]\n\n**Clear and useful README**\n- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]\n- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]\n\n**Proper dependency management**\n- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]\n\n**Good project management**\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]\n- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.
