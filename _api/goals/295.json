You would be working remotely with in-person support one to two days a week from Jeff.\n\nFor more information, read the [project proposal][].\n\n## Context\n\nThis is not a drill. This the real tamale.\n\nIf you choose this goal, you'll be working for an external client (i.e. not someone within Learners Guild) on a live, in-production codebase.\n\nOnly choose this goal if you are ready and willing to commit to multiple weeks of work in a new codebase with less support available. Because the technology is not managed by Learners Guild, there is no guarantee that coaches will be able to support you. You will likely need to figure out a lot of things on your own.\n\nThis is a great goal for testing your skills in a \"live\" remote development environment. It will be fun. It will not be easy.\n\n## Specifications\n\nSpecs will be determined at project start time.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Literator's site][literator]\n- [Project Proposal Literator - Learners Guild][project-proposal]\n\nOn remote work:\n\n- [10 Secrets to Becoming a Great Remote Developer](https://x-team.com/blog/10-secrets-to-becoming-a-great-remote-developer/)\n- [8 Tips to Become an Effective Remote Developer](https://www.codementor.io/learn-programming/8-tips-to-become-an-effective-remote-developer)\n\n[literator]: http://www.literatorapp.com/\n[project-proposal]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/files/917811/DevelopmentProjectProposalLearnersGuild.pdf"
