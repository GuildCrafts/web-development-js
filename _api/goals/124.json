It is also a crucial tool for communicating effectively with other developers.\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [multiple-paradigms][multiple-paradigms] repo.\n- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] All tests are passing.\n- [ ] Can parse Markdown syntax ([reference](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)) and render correct HTML for...\n  - [ ] Paragraphs\n  - [ ] Headings\n  - [ ] Italicized text\n  - [ ] Bold text\n  - [ ] Links\n  - [ ] Images\n  - [ ] Unordered lists\n  - [ ] Ordered lists\n  - [ ] Blockquotes\n  - [ ] Horizontal rules\n  - [ ] Inline codes\n  - [ ] Code blocks\n- [ ] Object-oriented implementation employs key characteristics of the object-oriented style\n  - [ ] Encapsulation\n  - [ ] Message passing with objects\n  - [ ] Composition, inheritance, and delegation\n  - [ ] Polymorphism\n- [ ] Functional implementation employs key characteristics of the functional style\n  - [ ] Higher-order functions\n  - [ ] Pure functions\n  - [ ] Recursion\n  - [ ] Referential transparency\n- [ ] Imperative implementation employs key characteristics of the imperative style\n  - [ ] Subroutines\n  - [ ] Linear control flow\n  - [ ] Sequential state modifications\n  - [ ] Looping and branching statements\n\n### Required\n\n_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n### Stretch\n\nFor each programming paradigm, write a Markdown parser using a language that _specializes in that paradigm_.\n\n- [ ] Object-oriented-style Markdown parser is written in either [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)\n- [ ] Functional-style Markdown parser is written in either [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) or [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)\n- [ ] Imperative-style Markdown parser is written in either [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) or [Go](https://golang.org/)\\*\n\n_\\*It is a bit blasphemous to say that Go specializes in imperative programming, as it is a highly sophisticated language. That being said, it works just fine when using an imperative style._\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Well formatted code**\n- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]\n- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]\n\n**Clear and useful README**\n- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]\n- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]\n\n**Proper dependency management**\n- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]\n\n**Good project management**\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]\n- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.
