You'll be able to write scripts that look like this (although they may not have exactly the same interface, this is just an example):\n\n```javascript\nconst Station = require('./models/station')\nconst Passenger = require('./models/passenger')\n\n// let's move a passenger \"Sam\" from the Downtown station to Waterfront...\nconst sam = Passenger.find({name: 'Sam'})\nconst downtown = Station.find({location: 'Downtown'})\nconst waterfront = Station.find({location: 'Waterfront'})\n\nsam.setStation(downtown)\nsam.buyTicket({to: waterfront})\n\nconst train = downtown.nextTrain()\ntrain.moveToNextStation()\ntrain.onboard()\n\nwhile (train.currentStation !== waterfront) {\n  train.moveToNextStation()\n}\n\ntrain.offboard()\nsam.currentStation\n// Sam is now at the Waterfront!\n```\n\nUse whichever database you prefer. However, it is recommended that you use a relational, open-source data store like PostgreSQL.\n\nTo help you get started with some seed data, here is a list of the train stations in this fictional city (they are along a circular line, so the station after `Museum Isle` is `Downtown`).\n\n```\n1. Downtown\n2. Elm Street\n3. Forest Gardens\n4. Annex\n5. 10th Ave\n6. Waterfront\n7. Colosseum\n8. Central Station\n9. Parkside\n10. Grand Boulevard\n11. Monument Valley\n12. Museum Isle\n```\n\nWhen you complete this goal, consider doing the next iteration: [MetroRail: Web API Design, Building, and Documentation][metrorail-web-api].\n\n## Context\n\nMost of software is a _model_ of some real-world system. It follows that being able to develop good models is a crucial skill.\n\nIn this case, the model is both one that should be familiar to anyone who has ever ridden public transit in a city. You also have very clear specifications to follow, so most of the guesswork has been taken out of the process.\n\nAs you build this project, you'll likely encounter questions such as:\n\n- Is this a property or a method?\n- If a method, is it a method of the instance or the class?\n- Where does this feature belong? If in a class, which class?\n- What are the expected inputs and outputs?\n- What is an unexpected input?\n- How should I test this?\n- How can the program handle failure gracefully?\n- When and how should model data be retrieved from and persisted to the data store?\n\n## Specifications\n\n#### General\n\n- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.\n-

module exists with configuration options to specify which database to use.\n- [ ] All tests pass when using the alternate database.\n\n[mit-license]:
