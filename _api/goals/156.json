  "content": "# Core Data Structures [Basic]\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm\n- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts\n- Are familiar with the interfaces of core JavaScript objects: Object, Array, String, etc.\n- Are interested in common data structures\n- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a sub-goal of [Core Data Structures][core-ds]. Reference that goal for more description, context, and resources.\n\nComplete **ONLY** the [Basic Data Structures][list-basic-ds] from the list, not the [Advanced][list-advanced-ds]. That's a [separate goal][core-ds-advanced]. :)\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.\n- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] All tests are passing.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Node` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Node`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Linked List` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Linked List`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Stack` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Stack`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Queue` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Queue`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Queue` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Queue`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Node` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Node`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Doubly-Linked List` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Doubly-Linked List`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Double Node` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Double Node`.\n- [ ] A working implementation of the `Set` data structure is complete.\n- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Set`.\n structure.\n- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.\n- [ ] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.\n- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.\n- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.\n- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.\n- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n### Stretch\n\nPick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.\n\n- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.\n- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:\n  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_.\n  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.\n\n\n[core-ds]: {{ site.url }}{% link _goals/128-Core_Data_Structures.md %}\n[core-ds-advanced]: {{ site.url }}{% link _goals/157-Core_Data_Structures-Advanced.md %}\n[list-basic-ds]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-data-structures/blob/master/data-structures.md#basic-data-structures\n[list-advanced-ds]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-data-structures/blob/master/data-structures.md#advanced-data-structures"
