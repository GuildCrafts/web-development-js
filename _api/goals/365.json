This means that you'll have to code the HTML and CSS to match the design guidelines given to you.\n\nWhen doing UI design and development work, it is also important to consider accessibility implications. In other words, you should design interfaces that are usable by people with disabilities.\n\nWeb accessibility definition from [Wikipedia][wiki-web-accessibility]:\n\n> Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality.\n\nConsider reading the [W3C standard on Web Accessiblity](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) for more context.\n\n## Specifications\n\n#### General\n\n- [ ] Artifact is a GitHub repository.\n- [ ] All CSS files are in a `css/` directory.\n- [ ] Main page is called `index.html` and includes your full style guide.\n- [ ] No external CSS libraries/modules are used.
