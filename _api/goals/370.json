  "content": "# React Native API-Driven App\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Have done at least 2 projects using React\n- Have contributed to and our built Node.js web apps\n- Are interested in how to build and start a React-Native app\n- Are interested in how to start a cross platform development environment (iOS/Android)\n- Are interested in how to utilize React-Native's fetch method and/or additional libraries to pull third-party API data\n\n## Description\n\nBuild a React Native Search App that utilizes a third party API to fetch data and uses components to render the data.\n\nThis goal introduces you to the fundamentals of mobile development utilizing a language you have familiarity with. There is no need to adopt Swift or Objective C!\n\n**Step 1** - [Refer to this scaffold repo](https://github.com/pllearns/react-native-starter-code)\n\nThen create your own repo and follow the `readme` instructions on the scaffold repo.\n\n**Step 2** - Find a third-party API to play with\n\nSuggestions:\n- [OMDB Api](http://www.omdbapi.com/)\n- [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/)\n- [Yelp Api](https://www.yelp.com/developers)\n\n## Context\n\nYou want to build an app with a simple UI. Stay away from too many form fields, and keep the components' state management minimal.\n\nThis is a great project if you want to jump start your skills in mobile development. The [resources](#resources) will help you understand the benefits of using React Native to develop in the mobile space. \n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] __10:__ You have an app component that feeds both Android and iOS JS files\n- [ ] __10:__ You can start the app with both `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android`\n- [ ] __10:__ You have at least 3 tests written using `jest` \n- [ ] __10:__ You have a home page that contains at least one touchable navigation button \n- [ ] __10:__ You have at least one extra screen to navigate to with rendered data \n- [ ] __10:__ Your rendered data is minimal in design and clean \n- [ ] __10:__ Your code is clean, and components are explicity named and have minimal responsibilities\n- [ ] __50:__ You are able to render third API data through navigating to a separate screen (example: a search button that `onClick` takes you to a results page.\n- [ ] __30:__ You have a complete `readme` that documents how to start your app and set up the dev environment *hint: the scaffold repo will start you in the right direction*\n- [ ] __30:__ You are properly protecting sensitive API ids and secret keys using `config` or `env`\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Tutorial - Build a React Native App from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OPRhelEIU&t=41s)\n- [React Native Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)\n- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n- [Create a React Native Search App](https://medium.com/lorenzo-codes/creating-a-react-native-search-app-88b8530da697)"
