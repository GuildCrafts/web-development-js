Read articles, watch videos, complete lessons and exercises, and implement a final project.\n\nThis goal makes heavy use of external resources: the [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), books like [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net), and various [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8wwnhdkPE4).\n\nFork the the [core-object-oriented-javascript repository][core-oojs] and use the fork as your project artifact.\n\nIn the [README.md][core-oojs-readme] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace, or faster to get the most out of it.\n\n## Context\n\nWhile JavaScript is not a strictly object-oriented language, it does have lots of interesting object-oriented features.\n\nBecoming a fluent JS developer means having an intimate knowledge with the particularities of the JS object model, with things like `this` and constructor functions and prototypes... It's a different way of structuring code from the classical model.\n\nChoose this goal if you've wondered how objects work in JavaScript and are looking to immerse yourself in an intensive and highly structured study.\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-oojs][core-oojs] repo.\n- [ ] All readings and videos in the `README` are completed and checked off.\n- [ ] All exercises and lessons in the `README` are completed and checked off.\n- [ ] Final project is complete.\n- [ ] Final project code is in the `Frogger` directory of the artifact.\n\n\n### Stretch\n\n- [ ] All stretch tasks in the `README` are completed.\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Clean code and commit messages**\n- Code is well formatted with proper spacing and indentation. [20 points]\n- Descriptive, well-named functions, variables, files, CSS classes, etc. [20 points]\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [20 points]\n\n*Note: Make sure to checkoff your progress and push your repo to github at least twice a day.*\n\n**Follows object-oriented principles**\n- Final project follows the [principle of coupling][principle-coupling], also known as \"separation of concerns\". [20 points]\n- Final project follows the [principle of encapsulation][principle-encapsulation]. [20 points]\n- Final project follows the [principle of abstraction][principle-abstraction]\n- Final project follows the [principle of inheritance][principle-inheritance]\n\n[core-oojs]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-object-oriented-javascript\n[core-oojs-readme]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-object-oriented-javascript/blob/master/README.md\n[principle-encapsulation]: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-the-oop-principle-of-encapsulation--gamedev-2187\n[principle-abstraction]: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-the-oop-principle-of-abstraction--gamedev-2386\n[principle-inheritance]: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-the-oop-principle-of-inheritance--gamedev-2536\n[principle-coupling]: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-the-oop-principle-of-coupling--gamedev-1935"}
