Also, the tech industry in the US has plenty of problems with systematic discrimination in the form of racism, sexism, classism, ablism, cissexism, and others.\n\nFiguring out how to find and build a supportive, nurturing, and safe community within the industry is important for all web developers at the start of their career. This goal is intended to help you better orient and understand the larger community and to find out how and where to make your place within it.\n\n## Specifications\n\nEach of these sections is a \"mini-project\".\n\nAfter you complete each mini-project, consider sharing your findings/learnings with other learners! Lots of people will likely benefit from what you discover.\n\n### General\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a gist with a Markdown file containing links and text\n\n### Contribute to Open Source\n\nFind an open source project that you are interested in, fork it, pick an open issue, resolve it, and then open a pull request.\n\nGetting started with open source can be a bit daunting or intimidating, but luckily there are lots of good resources out there to help you out. Check out the links in the [Resources](#resources).\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains link to pull request on an open-source project.\n\n### Publish your Personal Website\n\nHaving your own website is a great way to show off your accomplishments and interests, and to let people (like potential employers!) find you.\n\nConsider including things like:\n\n- A list of projects you've worked on\n- Blog posts about things you're interested in\n- Links to your profile page on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.\n\nLuckily, you can create a free website with GitHub Pages, so you don't even have to spend any $.\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains link to personal website.\n\n### Find and Join some Meetups and Workshops\n\n[Meetups][meetup] are a great way to connect with other people in your industry, learn about new projects and technologies, share knowledge, and find work opportunities. Workshops can also be good places to learn a new skill and build community, but sometimes they can be costly.\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains list of good Meetups and/or workshops with links and any thoughts/reflections after attending.\n\n_Note: try to only attend events that take place outside of Guild hours. If you absolutely have to miss Guild hours to attend the best event ever, be sure to let the appropriate people know when you'll be gone._\n\n### Find and Follow Industry Thought Leaders\n\nDiscover interesting folks to follow on Twitter, Medium, and other social media sites. This is a good way to find inspirational folks and maybe even make a new friend or two. :)\n\nTo get you started, here are a few folks from my list that I'd recommend: [Anil Dash](https://twitter.com/anildash), [Erica Joy](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy), and [Vanessa Hurst](https://twitter.com/DBNess).\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains list of interesting people to follow with links to their social media profile(s).\n\n### Stretch\n\n### Discover Industry Conferences\n\nSome love them, some hate them, but for better or worse conferences are a big part of the social sphere in tech and they can be a good place to meet people and build community. Unfortunately, many conferences are really expensive. However, companies are often willing to fund their employees to go to conferences. Some conferences even offer discounts and scholarships for people who would otherwise not be able to attend.\n\nHere are few good conferences I'm aware of (haven't had the chance to attend, but I've heard good things from trusted people): [AlterConf](https://alterconf.com/), [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/), and [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/).\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains a list of relevant and useful conferences.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [List of projects which have curated tasks specifically for new contributors][up-for-grabs]\n- Guide: [\"How to get started with Open Source\"][how-to-get-started-with-open-source]\n- [A list of awesome beginners-friendly projects][awesome-for-beginners]\n- Quora question: [\"What's a good open source project on GitHub for beginners to contribute to?\"][quora-open-source-for-beginners]\n- [First Timers Only][firsttimersonly]\n\n[meetup]: http://www.meetup.com/\n\n[firsttimersonly]: http://www.firsttimersonly.com/\n[up-for-grabs]: http://up-for-grabs.net/\n[how-to-get-started-with-open-source]: https://www.hackerearth.com/getstarted-opensource/\n[awesome-for-beginners]: https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners\n[quora-open-source-for-beginners]: https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-good-open-source-project-on-GitHub-for-beginners-to-contribute-to\n\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
