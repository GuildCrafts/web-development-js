It is a good idea to pick a library that has a solid test suite.\n\nThen, each team writes a complete set of documentation for the **public interface** of the library. This should take 1-2 days. The documentation must be _thorough_ and _complete_.\n\nOnce each team has written their documentation, they present it to the other team. Each team then attempts to write the library so that it implements the interface and functionality identified in the documentation. This should take another 1-2 days.\n\nWhen both teams are finished, analyze each other's codebase and compare it to the original library. How did it differ? Run the tests from the original library against the team's code. How many tests pass? When the new implementation differs from the original, is it because the documentation was incomplete or unspecific enough or because the implementation was lacking?\n\nAn example of good (thorough and complete) documentation is the [docs for the Lodash library](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4). For each method, it includes a brief **description**, a list of **arguments** and their data type, the **return value** and type, and an **example usage**.\n\nIf you're at a loss for which library to choose, here are a few that would be good for this goal:\n\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors\n\n## Context\n\nDevelopers spend a lot of time reading documentation. Most developers will eventually write documentation as well, sometimes for code they've written and sometimes for someone else's code.\n\nHaving clear, concise, descriptive, and useful documentation is a mark of quality and craftspersonship. Learning to write (and to read) documentation is thus an important skill for any aspiring developer.\n\nWhen you take this goal on, you'll be forced to think about code in a way you may not have thought about it before. You'll have to consider the proper way to _describe_ code, not just write it. You'll have to think critically about how the code works. You'll need to be diligent about using proper technical terms and language so that your documentation is not confusing or vague.\n\nConversely, you'll also have to read _someone else's_ documentation and try to interpret it. This is not unlike how a translator takes one language and converts it to another.\n\nHave fun!\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact contains 2 sets of well-written, thorough and complete documentation.\n  - [ ] Each documentation set lists all public modules/classes and their methods/functions for the library.\n  - [ ] Properties (if any) are organized by their module/class.\n  - [ ] Property entries specify the name and data type of the property, its default value (if any), and a brief description of what it is for.\n  - [ ] Methods/functions are organized by their module/class.\n  - [ ] Each method/function entry specifies the method/function name, a brief description of what it does, its parameters and their data types, which parameters are required and which are optional, and what the return data type is.\n- [ ] Artifact contains 2 libraries that fulfill the interface and functionality outlined in the corresponding documentation.\n  - [ ] Test suite can be run with the command `npm test`.\n  - [ ] Every public method/function is tested.\n  - [ ] All tests are passing.\n- [ ] Source code is written with ES6.\n- [ ] Source library is properly attributed according to its license.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n## Stretch\n\n- [ ] Each method/function entry in the documentation includes an example of use.\n- [ ] Documentation is written inline with [JSDoc][jsdoc] format.\n- [ ] Documentation can be built into a static website with the command `npm run docs` (hint: use a builder like the [documentation package][npm-documentation]).\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Well formatted code**\n- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]\n- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]\n\n**Clear and useful README**\n- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]\n- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]\n\n**Proper dependency management**\n- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]\n\n**Good project management**\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]\n- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.
