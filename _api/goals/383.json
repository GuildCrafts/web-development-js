  "content": "# CRUD Mutably\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Can build basic web sites with HTML & CSS\n- Can add behavior to a web site with JavaScript\n- Are familiar with DOM manipulation\n- Are interested in making more complex interactive web pages\n\n## Description\n\n[Mutably](http://mutably.herokuapp.com/) is a mutable, RESTful, CRUD API. This means that it has endpoints that you can interact with RESTfully via a front-end.\n\nVisit the repo page for information about the resources available and how to interact with them: [https://github.com/GuildCrafts/mutably](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/mutably)\n\nYour goal is to build a front-end that consumes the Mutably API. You can choose any one of the 3 resources. You front-end needs to complete all of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.\n\nFor the goal, you will start with [this scaffolded template](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/mutably-starter). Fork to get started.\nYou will use jQuery to complete this goal.\n\n## Context\n\nInteracting with a third-party API is a key skill for any developer. Most APIs have extensive documentation and require a fair amount of \"overhead\" just to get started working with them.\n\nNot Mutably. This API is _way_ simpler, with just a few _endpoints_ handling a few different _resources_.\n\nThis goal is designed as an introduction to working with third-party APIs so that you can familiarize yourself with the core ideas before moving on to work with bigger, more complex APIs (like GitHub or Twitter).\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] __5:__ Your repo is a fork of [mutably-starter](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/mutably-starter).\n- [ ] __5:__ Your repo has a README with instructions for how to run your project.\n- [ ] __15:__ Your app is SPA (single page app). All CRUD actions take place on the same page, preferably the root (`/`) route.\n- [ ] __10:__ All interaction with the API happens with jQuery's AJAX function -- don't submit data via forms. You can use `form` html tags, but do all your form submission in your `js`. Make use of jQuery's `event.preventDefault()`.\n- [ ] __15:__ A user can read and display all the data for a resource.\n- [ ] __10:__ A user can create a new item via a create form. When the user creates a new item, that item should either get appended to the page or all the items should get re-retrieved in the `js`. No full page refresh.\n- [ ] __10:__ A user can update an existing item. Updating happens inline. This means that there is an edit button next to each item that, when clicked, the item text gets replaced with an pre-populated editable, input field. And the edit button becomes a save button. Once the save button is clicked and success message comes back from the server, then then input gets replaced with the updated text. No page refresh.\n  For example, this: <br>\n  <img width=\"229\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-05-11 at 3 26 09 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3010270/25974508/4ac57980-365e-11e7-8b1f-6cf9eefaac22.png\">\n  <br>\n  becomes:\n  <br>\n  <img width=\"253\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-05-11 at 3 26 18 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3010270/25974512/5024433e-365e-11e7-802f-c60afacddecd.png\">\n  <br>\n  When the user clickes the edit button.\n- [ ] __10:__ A user can delete an existing item via a delete button next to each item. No page refresh.\n- [ ] __10:__ Use a UI library to make your site look nice.\n- [ ] __5:__ The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.\n- [ ] __5:__ App is deployed on Heroku.\n\n### Stretch\n\n- [ ] Create another version of your front-end using a front-end framework such as React or Angular.\n\n---\n\n***If the mutably data gets too crazy from people adding / deleting things, you can reset the data to the seed data [here](http://mutably.herokuapp.com/).***\n\n***Insider tip: there is an example \"solution\" (remember, there are MANY ways to hack it!) in the [solution branch](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/mutably-starter/tree/solution) of the starter template.***"
