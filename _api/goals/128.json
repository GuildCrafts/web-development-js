Sometimes it's useful to peek under the hood and see how the engine works.\n\nThe nice thing is, most data structures are **actually quite simple** when you get down to it. They have straight-forward, relatively small interfaces.\n\nIn a larger sense, being more familiar with data structures is helpful for you ability to think about data more abstractly, and to design better software.\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.\n- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.\n- [ ] All tests are passing.\n- [ ] For each data structure in [the list][list-ds], there exists:\n  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property.\n  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure.\n\n### Required\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n### Stretch\n\nPick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.\n\n- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.\n- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:\n  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_.\n  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Well formatted code**\n- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]\n- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]\n\n**Clear and useful README**\n- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]\n- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]\n\n**Proper dependency management**\n- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]\n\n**Good project management**\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]\n- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.
