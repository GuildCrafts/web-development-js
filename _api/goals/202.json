Publish the code as a package to NPM (stretch).\n\nIn addition to implementing the functions themselves, write tests for each of the functions. Luckily for you, _most of the work of writing tests has already been done for you_. Use the descriptions and examples from the documentation to make your tests.\n\nFor example, a test for the [`_.sortBy()`](http://underscorejs.org/#sortBy) Collection method could look like this (using the Node.js builtin `assert` library):\n\n```javascript\nconst assert = require('assert')\nconst _ = require('collections.js')\n\nassert.deepEqual(\n  _.sortBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], (num) => Math.sin(num)),\n  [5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2],\n  \"Returns a (stably) sorted copy of list, ranked in ascending order by the results of running each value through iteratee.\"\n)\n\nconst stooges = [{name: 'moe', age: 40}, {name: 'larry', age: 50}, {name: 'curly', age: 60}];\n\nassert.deepEqual(\n  _.sortBy(stooges, 'name'),\n  [{name: 'curly', age: 60}, {name: 'larry', age: 50}, {name: 'moe', age: 40}],\n  \"Iteratee may also be the string name of the property to sort by (eg. length)\"\n)\n```\n\nNote that the code and messages were shamelessly copied directly from the [Underscore docs][underscore].\n\n## Context\n\nThis project will take you into the realm of real a JavaScript library used by thousands (maybe millions) of developers across the world. You'll have to think like an open-source software developer and learn the benefits and constraints of such a role.\n\nIn addition, your code may be used by other developers to make their jobs easier. Hopefully this project helps you better understand how to contribute to the open source community so that you can be an active member throughout your career.\n\nThe questions that this project will raise are:\n- What happens \"under the hood\" of the most common utility functions?\n- How do we write packages that are easy to understand and simple to use out of the box?\n- How to publish a package to NPM? (part of stretch goal)\n\nThis goal is the sister goal of [Common JS Utility Functions - Lodash](37-Common_JS_Utility_Functions-Lodash.md).\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Tests and correct implementations exist for **64** (not all) utility functions from the Underscore library.\n- [ ] Functions are organized into files with the same names as the function groups from Underscore (e.g. \"Collections\", \"Functions\", \"Objects\").\n- [ ] All code is written with ES2015.\n- [ ] Includes a README that describes each method and provides an example of use.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n### Stretch\n\n- [ ] An additional **32** utility functions have tests and correct implementations.\n- [ ] Package is published to [NPM][npm].\n- [ ] All source code has inline documentation using [JSDoc][jsdoc] format.\n- [ ] Documentation is published a simple [GitHub Pages][github-pages] site (hint: use a builder like the [documentation package][npm-documentation]).\n\n---\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n**Well formatted code**\n- Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`). [50 points]\n- Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]\n\n**Clear and useful README**\n- Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]\n- Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]\n\n**Proper dependency management**\n- There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]\n\n**Good project management**\n- Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]\n- All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]\n- Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person.
