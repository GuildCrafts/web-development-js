  "content": "# Concept Focus: UX & UI\n\n## Challenge Rating\n\nThis goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...\n\n- Can choose a goal that fits your ZPD\n- Can build full-stack web apps with Node.js\n- Can use testing tools in the Node.js environment\n- Are comfortable jumping into a new codebase\n\n## Description\n\nTake two products from zero to proof-of-concept.\n\nGo through all stages of a product design/development lifecycle: ideation, story creation, UI/UX design, and implementation.\n\n_Concept focus_ goals like this one have some unique characteristics. If this is your first time working on one, read the [Context](#context) for more information.\n\nIn working on this goal, you should explore concepts like:\n\n- user interface design\n- user experience design\n- user stories\n- product specs\n- product wireframes\n- product mockups\n- the design/development cycle\n\nFor guidance and support, start with the [Resources](#resources) provided.\n\n## Context\n\nThis goal is a _concept focus_ goal, which means that it is not specific about the project you build, but rather the concepts that you apply in building it.\n\nYou will have to choose _what to build_. The details of the project are up to you. The project can be pre-written (so long as you have permission to use it) or a new one of your own choosing. You can even choose projects from other goals.\n\nFor inspiration, review the [list of project ideas][project-ideas].\n\nThe advantage of this is that you can work on whatever kind of project you like, so long as you focus on building your skills and knowledge of the concept in question.\n\nThe disadvantage is that it is very easy to get distracted or to waste time on non-essential tasks like making decisions about project design. It is also likely that you won't have as much support available, since other learners and coaches won't have worked on the same project as you. If you prefer to have more structure and deterministic outcomes, you may not enjoy this goal.\n\nThat being said, if you have the self-discipline, motivation, and resolve, you will likely benefit from choosing this goal.\n\n## Specifications\n\n- [ ] Artifact produced is a GitHub repo.\n- [ ] Repo contains subdirectories for 2 products.\n- [ ] Each product contains a `design/` subdirectory and an `implementation/` subdirectory.\n- [ ] Design subdirectory for each product includes:\n  - [ ] A product overview in a `README.md` file.\n  - [ ] A list of user stories in a `stories.md` file.\n  - [ ] A set of wireframe files in a `wireframes/` subdirectory.\n  - [ ] A set of mockup files in a `mockups/` subdirectory.\n  - [ ] A style guide specifying colors, typography, and guidelines for key components.\n- [ ] Implementation subdirectory for each product includes:\n  - [ ] A static web site (front-end only) with views matching the design mockups.\n  - [ ] Static design assets (images and fonts).\n  - [ ] \"Proof-of-concept\" behavior (i.e. core UX features are there, but don't need to be fully functional).\n- [ ] All code added to implementation is added through pull requests that reference the user stories and/or mockups it implements.\n- [ ] The best resources you find for learning testing are added to a file `resources.md`.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\n\n## Stretch\n\n- [ ] 2 more products are fully designed.\n- [ ] Features for all products are fully implemented.\n\n## Resources\n\n##### Tools\n\n- [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) #ui #wireframe\n- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) #ui #mockup #design\n- [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) #ui #design #mockup\n- Huge Inc.'s [Style Guide Builder](https://hugeinc.github.io/styleguide/) #ui #design\n\n##### Articles\n\n- Lots of good stuff on [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)\n\n##### Courses\n\n- Frontend Masters: [Lean Front-End Engineering (5h)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/lean-front-end-engineering/) #ui #design\n- Frontend Masters: [Web UI Architecture (4h)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-ui-architecture/) #ui #architecture\n- Treehouse: [Sketch Basics (2h)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/sketch-basics) #design #sketch #ui\n- Treehouse: [Design and Development](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/design-and-development) #ui #design #ruby\n\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[project-ideas]: {{ site.url }}{% link project-ideas.md %}"
