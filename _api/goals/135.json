Project review for past week for projects that you were lead coach on. You should aim for **100% of project reviews**.\n1. Responding to coach queue requests for projects that you are coach lead on.\n1. Everything else.\n\n## Completion\n\nAs a coach, your \"completeness\" and XP is calculated differently than when working on projects.\n\nYour completeness is the sum of your percent of primary requests claimed and your percent of communal requests claimed. Here's the formula:\n\n```\ncompleteness = % of primary claimed + % of communal claimed\n```\n\nThis completeness % is then used to calculate how much XP you earned for a cycle of coaching.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Coaching Guide](https://playbook.learnersguild.org/Learning_Guide/Coaching.html)"
