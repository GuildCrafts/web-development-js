Let's go early aughts style and call it... _Postalicious_.\n\nPostalicious is an app that lets you send custom HTTP requests to a server and inspect both the request and the response messages. In this way, it lets you control things like request parameters, headers, and the message body, and then you can see the raw response from the server.\n\nHere's a wireframe of the Postalicious interface that you can use to design around:\n\n![postalicious](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/709100/23727389/d4195ca8-0425-11e7-8a02-fe42d4938b9a.png)\n\nIn order to give Postalicious something to practice on, you'll also build a simple HTTP server using Node.js and [Express][express] (we'll just call this the \"sandbox server\"). This server won't do much, but it will provide a range of response to different kinds of requests so that your Postalicious app has a good sandbox to play with.\n\nIf you are brand-new to HTTP, or just a little rusty, it is highly recommended that you go through some or all of the [courses and tutorials](#courses-and-tutorials) in the [resources](#resources) section. Don't limit yourself to just these resources — there are lots of good learning materials on the web — but these at least should put you on more solid footing.\n\nIt is recommended that you build the sandbox server first, and then the Postalicious app after.\n\nFinally, as a stretch exercise, use Postalicious to send requests to a real-world web API.\n\n## Context\n\nHTTP is what makes the web work. Well, it's part of what makes the web work. Knowing what it is and how it works is important for any web developer, because it makes everything else that is built _on top of_ HTTP easier to understand, debug, and make sense of.\n\nIn this goal, you'll become familiar with terms like `request`, `response`, `client`, `server`, `status code`, `protocol`, `header`, `body`, and `HTTP verb`. You'll also have to deal with the parts of a `URL` (Uniform Resource Locator): the `protocol`, `host`, `port`, (resource) `path`, and `query`.\n\nThat may sound like a lot of vocabulary words. It is. But these are the building blocks of the web - if you don't know what they mean, this is a perfect opportunity to find out!\n\nThe good news is that HTTP is really not hard to work with - it's built to be human-readable. The following message is an abridged, but not unrelated, version  to what your browser sends every time you search for \"hedgehog\" on Google:\n\n```http\nGET /search?q=hedgehog HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.google.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html\n\n```\n\nLet's break that down quickly and put some of those vocabulary words to use. If you read it left-to-right, top-to-bottom, it can be interpreted like this:\n\n> (1st line): Send a **request** using the GET method/**verb** to the **path** `/search` with a **query** string containing one key `q` having the value `hedgehog`, using version `1.1` of the hypertext transfer protocol (**HTTP**).\n> <br>(2nd line): In the **header**, specify the **host** to send this request to the **server** at `www.google.com`\\*.\n> <br>(3rd line): Include a user agent key in the **header** to identify the **client** as a Chrome browser operating on a Mac computer running OSX 10.12.3.\n> <br>(4th line): Use the accept key in the **header** with the value `text/html` to tell the server which content types (also called [MIME types][list-mime-types]) the client can understand so that it sends the appopriate type in the **body** of the **response** message.\n> <br>(5th line): Leave a blank line to signal the end of the **message**.\n\n_\\*Implied in this message is the fact that this request will be sent to **port** 80 because this is the default for HTTP requests._\n\nIf that all sounds like ancient Greek to you, never fear. If you take it one step at a time and dive into each concept, experiment with it in your code, and do your proper research, you'll get to a place where the above makes perfect sense.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**General**\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is a repo with at least two sub-folders: `postalicious/` and `sandbox-server/`.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n**Sandbox Server**\n\n- [ ] Can run the command `npm run sandbox-server` (or `npm run sb`, if you want to save some typing) to start the sandbox web server at port 3000.\n- [ ] The sandbox server source code is written using the [Express][express] library.\n- [ ] Sending a `GET` request to the path `/` responds with...\n  - [ ] a 200 (OK) status code\n  - [ ] a plain-text response body with the content `Welcome to Sandbox!`\n  - [ ] the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`\n- [ ] Sending a `GET` request to the path `/search?q=doodads` responds with...\n  - [ ] a 200 (OK) status code\n  - [ ] a plain-text response body with the content `You searched for: \"doodads\"` (it doesn't need to actually do any searching, just return the plain text)\n  - [ ] the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`\n- [ ] Sending a `GET` request to the path `/search` responds with...\n  -
