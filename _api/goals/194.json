Let's go early aughts style and call it... _Postalicious_.\n\nPostalicious is an app that lets you send custom HTTP requests to a server and inspect both the request and the response messages. In this way, it lets you control things like request parameters, headers, and the message body, and then you can see the raw response from the server.\n\nHere's a wireframe of the Postalicious interface that you can use to design around:\n\n<img alt=\"Postalicious mockup\" width=800 src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/709100/23727389/d4195ca8-0425-11e7-8a02-fe42d4938b9a.png\">\n\nIn order to give Postalicious something to practice on, you'll also build a simple HTTP server using Node.js and [Express][express] (we'll just call this the \"sandbox server\"). This server won't do much, but it will provide a range of response to different kinds of requests so that your Postalicious app has a good sandbox to play with.\n\nIf you are brand-new to HTTP, or just a little rusty, it is highly recommended that you go through some or all of the [courses and tutorials](#courses-tutorials-articles) in the [resources](#resources) section. Don't limit yourself to just these resources — there are lots of good learning materials on the web — but these at least should put you on more solid footing.\n\nIt is recommended that you build the sandbox server first, and then the Postalicious app after. However, if you'd like to get a jump start on the sandbox server so that you can spend more time on Postalicious, you can use the provided [Scaffolded Sandbox Server](#scaffolded-sandbox-server) code.\n\nFinally, as a stretch exercise, use Postalicious to send requests to a real-world web API.\n\n### How Postalicious Works\n\nThe Postalicious app lets users define HTTP requests to some external server via an HTML form on a web page (i.e. client), and then sends the request from the Postalicious server, reads the response, and sends it back to the client.\n\nThese are the steps, simplified and demonstrated in the diagram below:\n\n1. Client sends request with form data to the Postalicious server\n2. Postalicious server parses form data and builds a request to an external server (in this case at the url `http://www.foo.com`)\n3. Postalicious receives response from external server (`foo.com`)\n4. Postalicious sends response to client, showing both the initial request and the final response from `foo.com`\n\n<img alt=\"Postalicious flow\" width=800 src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/709100/24780424/379ee40a-1b05-11e7-8c40-20c66368c26a.png\">\n\n_Note that the above diagram assumes that Postalicious is sending a request to a site on the world wide web. But you could also send requests to URLs hosted by servers on your own computer, which is exactly what you are doing when you send requests to the sandbox server._\n\n## Context\n\nHTTP is what makes the web work. Well, it's part of what makes the web work. Knowing what it is and how it works is important for any web developer, because it makes everything else that is built _on top of_ HTTP easier to understand, debug, and make sense of.\n\nIn this goal, you'll become familiar with terms like `request`, `response`, `client`, `server`, `status code`, `protocol`, `header`, `body`, and `HTTP verb`. You'll also have to deal with the parts of a `URL` (Uniform Resource Locator): the `protocol`, `host`, `port`, (resource) `path`, and `query`.\n\nThat may sound like a lot of vocabulary words. It is. But these are the building blocks of the web - if you don't know what they mean, this is a perfect opportunity to find out!\n\nThe good news is that HTTP is really not hard to work with - it's built to be human-readable. The following message is an abridged, but not unrelated, version  to what your browser sends every time you search for \"hedgehog\" on Google:\n\n```http\nGET /search?q=hedgehog HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.google.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html\n\n```\n\nLet's break that down quickly and put some of those vocabulary words to use. If you read it left-to-right, top-to-bottom, it can be interpreted like this:\n\n> (1st line): Send a **request** using the GET method/**verb** to the **path** `/search` with a **query** string containing one key `q` having the value `hedgehog`, using version `1.1` of the hypertext transfer protocol (**HTTP**).\n> <br>(2nd line): In the **header**, specify the **host** to send this request to the **server** at `www.google.com`\\*.\n> <br>(3rd line): Include a user agent key in the **header** to identify the **client** as a Chrome browser operating on a Mac computer running OSX 10.12.3.\n> <br>(4th line): Use the accept key in the **header** with the value `text/html` to tell the server which content types (also called [MIME types][list-mime-types]) the client can understand so that it sends the appopriate type in the **body** of the **response** message.\n> <br>(5th line): Leave a blank line to signal the end of the **message**.\n\n_\\*Implied in this message is the fact that this request will be sent to **port** 80 because this is the default for HTTP requests._\n\nIf that all sounds like ancient Greek to you, never fear. If you take it one step at a time and dive into each concept, experiment with it in your code, and do your proper research, you'll get to a place where the above makes perfect sense.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**General**\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is a repo with at least two sub-folders: `postalicious/` and `sandbox-server/`.\n- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.\n- [ ] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.\n- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.\n- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.\n- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.\n- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n**Sandbox Server**\n\n_Note: to get a jump start on the sandbox server, you can use the provided [Scaffolded Sandbox Server](#scaffolded-sandbox-server) code.
