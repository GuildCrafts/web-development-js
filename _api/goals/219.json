It's meant to simulate the experience of developing a feature for an existing \"live\" open source project.\n\nUse snapshot goals to learn about working with larger code bases, and getting a simulated experience of being in a live sprint to push a set of features across the finish line.\n\n## Specifications\n\n\n- [ ] The artifact produced is 3 goals submitted to [web-development-js][webdevjs]\n- [ ] All goals closely follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [ ] All three goals in the series work off the same codebase and do not depend on each other\n- [ ] Each goal specifically targets a skill group (square) on the [matrix]()\n- [ ] Each goal spells out the skill sets it's meant to develop\n\n\n### Stretch\n\nUse the stretch goals to go deeper into the nuts and bolts of HTTP.\n\n- [ ] Write a pull request against the [matrix](http://matrix.apps.learnersguild.org/) adding the goals to their relative skill groups\n- [ ] Write a fourth related goal\n\n## Quality Rubric\n\n- Goals closely follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) [20 points]\n- Goals have clear specifications with wireframes and user stories [30 points]\n- Each goal repo has clear, reproduce-able instructions for setting it up [10]\n- Goals have clear quality rubrics [20 points]\n- Goals are properly sized to challenge a pair of level 3 players [20 points]\n\n\n## Resources\n\n- Checkout the [Timeoff Snapshot Approver]() and [Timeoff Snapshot International]() goals\n\n[trossello]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/Trossello\n[webdevjs]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/\n[floworky]: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/floworky"}
