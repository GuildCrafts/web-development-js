# Core Vanilla JavaScript [Solo Study]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can open, edit, and save files with a text editor
- Can use a web browser to search, explore, and consume content from the Internet
- Are familiar with the concept of programs as instructions for a computer
- Are beginning to write correct JavaScript and understand its syntax
- Are getting started reading and writing JavaScript control structures, basic functions, and data types
- Are interested in strengthening your knowledge of and fluency with JavaScript

## Description

A day-by-day structured deep dive into the basics of JavaScript. Read articles, watch videos, complete lessons and exercises.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the [JavaScript Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics) course on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), books like [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net), and various video tutorials.

Fork the the [core-vanilla-javascript repository][core-vjs] and use the fork as your project artifact.

In the [solo_study.md][core-vjs-solo] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace or faster to get the most out of it.

## Context

Before getting started building web applications, it's important to get a grounding into the basics of programming and JavaScript. Becoming a full stack web developer means that you need to be comfortable with the core language first, before using it in the web stack.

Choose this goal if you're just getting started with the basics of JavaScript and programming and want to gain a solid foothold. This will be an immersive, intensive, and highly structured study.
