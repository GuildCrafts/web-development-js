# Coaching

Join the coaching team.

- Perform code and project reviews
- Providing technical guidance and advice to players
- Assisting players in their project work
- Supporting teams in completing their projects
- Conducting cognitive apprenticeship sessions

## Priorities

As a Coach, you should prioritize your time this way:

1. Project review for past week for projects that you were lead coach on. You should aim for **100% of project reviews**.
1. Responding to coach queue requests for projects that you are coach lead on.
1. Everything else.

## Completion

As a coach, your "completeness" and XP is calculated differently than when working on projects.

Your completeness is the sum of your percent of primary requests claimed and your percent of communal requests claimed. Here's the formula:

```
completeness = % of primary claimed + % of communal claimed
```

This completeness % is then used to calculate how much XP you earned for a cycle of coaching.
