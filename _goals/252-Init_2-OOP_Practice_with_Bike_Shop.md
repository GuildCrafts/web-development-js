## Context

The series of initiation goals are designed for new members of Learners Guild to get oriented to the learning environment, build key foundational skills, and work on some fun projects.

1. [Init 1: Bossggle Word Game][bossggle-word-game]
1. [Init 2: Bike Shop OOP][bike-shop-oop]
1. [Init 3: Hello Web Servers][hello-web-servers]
1. [Init 4: Relational Databases][relational-databases]
1. [Init 5: Web APIs][web-apis]
1. [Init 6: Developer Tools][developer-tools]

By the time you are finished with these initiation goals, you should be skilled enough to complete the [Simple Book Store][simple-book-store] goal: it is a good target for you to aim for in your first 6 weeks.

This is the second goal. It is designed to introduce you to the Node.js programming environment and to object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

By the time you're done with this goal, you will have:

#### Stage 4

#### Stage 5

### Stretch

If you complete all of the specs listed above (the checkboxes), there's no reason to stop there! Try building more advanced features with these stretch specs.
