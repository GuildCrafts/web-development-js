# Level Up Your Environment

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Item one
- Item two

## Description

Improve your development environment - both on your computer and in the social world of software development!

In this goal, you'll complete a set of mini-projects to help you **level up** your **computer's development environment** and **get involved** with your local (and online) **developer community**.

You'll get to do things like contribute to an open source project, discover interesting conferences, create your own `dotfiles` repo, and improve your editor skills.

### Mini-Projects

Each of these mini-projects should take between 2-6 hours. The output of each mini-project will vary based on the type of project. Make sure to include a link to each output in your artifact.

You can do them in any order. It's recommended that you mix up the `Community` and `DevEnv` mini-projects, but do your own thing. :)

After you complete each project, consider sharing your findings/learnings with other learners! Lots of people will likely benefit from what you discover.

#### Find and Join some Meetups and Workshops [Community]

[Meetups][meetup] are a great way to connect with other people in your industry, learn about new projects and technologies, share knowledge, and find work opportunities. Workshops can also be good places to learn a new skill and build community, but sometimes they can be costly.

**Output:** compile a list of good Meetups and/or workshops with links. If you attend any of them, include your thoughts/reflections.

#### Find and Follow Industry Thought Leaders [Community]

Discover interesting folks to follow on Twitter, Medium, and other social media sites. This is a good way to find inspirational folks and maybe even make a new friend or two. :)

To get you started, here are a few folks from my list that I'd recommend: [Anil Dash](https://twitter.com/anildash), [Erica Joy](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy), and [Vanessa Hurst](https://twitter.com/DBNess).

**Output:** compile a list of interesting people to follow, along with links to their social media profile(s).

#### Discover Industry Conferences [Community]

Some love them, some hate them, but for better or worse conferences are a big part of the social sphere in tech and they can be a good place to meet people and build community. Unfortunately, many conferences are really expensive. However, companies are often willing to fund their employees to go to conferences. Some conferences even offer discounts and scholarships for people who would otherwise not be able to attend.

Here are few good conferences I'm aware of (haven't had the chance to attend, but I've heard good things from trusted people): [AlterConf](https://alterconf.com/), [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/), and [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/).

**Output:** compile a list of relevant and useful conferences. If you attend any of them, include your thoughts/reflections.

#### Contribute to Open Source [Community]

Find an open source project that you are interested in, fork it, pick an open issue, resolve it, and then open a pull request.

Getting started with open source can be a bit daunting or intimidating, but luckily there are lots of good resources out there to help you out. Check out the links in the [Open Source](#open-source) section of the [Resources](#resources).

**Output:** make a pull request on an open-source project. Link to the PR in your artifact.

#### Make Your Own Dotfiles [DevEnv]

Dotfiles are usually configuration files for things like your shell, languages, and packages. Many developers keep all their dotfiles organized in one repo.

Check out the links in the [Dotfiles & Environment Management](#dotfiles-environment-management) section of the [Resources](#resources) for more information and lots of examples of other dotfiles repos. One way to go is to fork a dotfiles repo that you like, and then customize it according to your preferences.

**Output:** create a dotfiles repo in your personal GitHub account. Link to the repo in your artifact.

#### Setup Homebrew and Install Some Packages [DevEnv]

[Homebrew][homebrew] is a useful tool for managing software and packages/libraries on a Mac. If you don't have it already, set it up!

Then, use the [homebrew-bundle][homebrew-bundle] package to create your own `Brewfile` to keep track of all your installed Homebrew packages. You may want to add this file to your `dotfiles` repo.

**Output:** create a `Brewfile` and add your favorite Homebrew packages to it.

#### Find and Install Editor Plugins [DevEnv]

If you aren't using a code editor that allows for plugins or extensions, you're missing out. The best editors have a plugin system so that developers can extend them to do all kinds of nifty things.

Check out the links in the [Editor Extensions and Plugins](#editor-extensions-and-plugins) section of the [Resources](#resources) to find packages for your editor of choice.

**Output:** compile a list of your favorite editor plugins.

#### Build an Atom Package (Stretch) [DevEnv]

The Atom editor has a robust package management system built-in. And, you can write them in JavaScript. :smile:

If you don't have an idea for a package that you'd like to build, you could find one that you like and reverse-engineer it. Also, you could do this [tutorial on building an Atom plugin][tutorial-atom-plugin].

**Output:** create an Atom package and publish as a repo on your personal GitHub account.
