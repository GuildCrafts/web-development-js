# Core Algorithms [Sorting, Searching, Graphing, Geometry]

This is a sub-goal of [Core Algorithms][core-algos].

Use the same specifications & quality rubric as in [Core Algorithms][core-algos], but complete **ONLY** the [Sorting and Searching](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms.md#sorting-and-searching) and [Graphing and Geometry](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/core-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms.md#graphing-and-geometry) algorithms, not the Classic, Numeric, or Set Operations. That's a [separate goal][core-algos-basic]. :)
