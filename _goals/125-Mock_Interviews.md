# Mock Interviews

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can build full-stack web applications
- Can contribute effectively on a team of web developers
- Can write feature-complete, quality code
- Can discuss and explain software using correct and precise technical terms
- Have solved logic puzzles while verbalizing your thought process
- Have used a whiteboard to diagram software systems
- Are familiar with typical software engineering interview questions
- Are interested in practicing being interviewed

## Description

Practice your interviewing skills with mock interviews.

Fork the [mock-interviews][mock-interviews] repository, add your questions and interview reflections/evaluations, and submit a pull request.

To complete this goal, each team member should conduct at least two mock interviews with an interviewer. The interviewer can be your coach, or one of your teammates. The rest of the time should be spent preparing for interviews and practicing common interview questions.

At the end of the project, submit the reflection/evaluation files for each interview conducted, including: the questions used, the interviewee reflection, and the interviewer's evaluation.

It is up to the interviewer to decide how they wish to conduct their interviews, but they should all use the same evaluation format provided in the repository.

## Context

Unfortunately, just being good at building software with a team is not enough to get hired as a software developer. The job interview is its own thing.

If you want to get a job, you'll need to _also_ be good at interviewing. This will mean different things for different companies, positions, and interviewers. There is no one question that they all ask, or one skill that they all look for.

As a result, the best way to prepare is to do "mock" interviews, with plenty of feedback from the interviewer. Not only will this give you practice answering questions and solving problems in an interview setting, but it will also help to demystify the interview process.
