You will need to get the LOS apps running locally if you haven't already.

- https://github.com/LearnersGuild/idm
- https://github.com/LearnersGuild/game
- https://github.com/LearnersGuild/graphiql

Follow the instructions in the README for each repo, starting with [IDM](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/idm).

## Context

This is the real deal.

You'll be working on real issues that really need to ship on a real app with real users. You'll be doing a mix of pairing with your team and doing cognitive apprenticeship with one of the LOS Software Engineers.

You should choose this goal if you are ready to try being part of a team working on a complex system of interconnected apps with real users and constraints. Be ready to adapt to changing circumstances and new challenges.

## Specifications

Specifications and requirements will come from LOS story tickets in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/learnersguild/) (the LOS issue tracking system).

## Quality Rubric

Quality requirements will be determined by the nature of the work you take on. No code will be merged without first being reviewed, and you can expect a high bar for quality.
