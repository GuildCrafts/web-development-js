# 15 Coding Exercises

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm
- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts
- Have used pseudocode as an intermediary step in writing a program
- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving

## Description

Complete 15 JavaScript coding exercises from the [coding-exercises-js][coding-exercises-js] repo.

These exercises involve writing small, single-file programs to solve a fun puzzle or problem.

In this goal, you'll be attempting to complete 15 exercises from [the list][readme].

The specs of this goal are designed to cover a wide range of basic concepts and get progressively more complex.

Write tests using the `assert` module in Node.js or whatever testing library you feel most comfortable with. Come up with your own inputs and outputs (using the example inputs and outputs as well) and try to test with as many (reasonable) edge cases as you can.

## Context

**Use a this goal to**:

- Take a break from pairing
- Get a sense of what you can accomplish by yourself
- Work on flexing problem solving skills
- Assess how much you've learned/grown as a developer

**To get a proper self assessment:**

- Start from scratch
- Don't look at other repos
- Understand and write every line of code
- Ask for coaching sessions
- Get frequent code reviews
