# Simple Book Store

## Challenge Rubric

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can build basic websites with HTML & CSS
- Can add behavior to a website with JavaScript
- Are familiar with SQL and relational databases like [PostgreSQL][]
- Are familiar with JavaScript promises
- Are interested in building full-stack web applications with frameworks like [Express][]
- Are interested in learning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) relational database interactions
- Are interested in server-side templating with tools like [Pug][] or [EJS][]

## Description

You've been tasked with building a web app for a local bookstore to help them manage their inventory.

Create a simple content management system that allows users to view, add, delete, and update books. Books entered in the system can be viewed in a list, as a single entry on its own page, or searched for using basic searches (by title, author, or genre).

To implement this system, you'll need to use (among other things)...

- a _web application framework_ (we recommend [Express][])
- a _database_ (we recommend [PostgreSQL][])
- a tool for server-side _HTML templating_ (we recommend [Pug][])

Don't sweat the UI design too much. If you want to add some quick and easy styles so that it doesn't look _too_ terrible, use a library like [Bootstrap][] or [Pure.css][pure-css].

Also, don't spend too much time coming up with book data if you need some seed data to work with. Use a fake data generator like [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) or just borrow a list from a data store like [this CSV](https://gist.github.com/jaidevd/23aef12e9bf56c618c41).

## Context

Many of the seemingly fancy apps on the web have functionality that can be reduced to just 4 simple operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (or CRUD for short). At their core, they are really just ways to perform these operations on some resource.

- Writing a new tweet on Twitter? That's a _create_ operation.
- Searching for photos tagged with `#kittenmittens` on Instagram? That's a _read_ operation.
- Editing your profile information on LinkedIn? That's an _update_ operation.
- Removing that 2am rant-post from Facebook? That's a _delete_ operation.

Like the steel frame of a skyscraper, _CRUD_ is the skeleton around which web applications are built: it's not very sexy, but you have to know how to do it.

In this goal, you'll be applying the CRUD pattern to the real-world system of a bookstore.

_Note: `PUT/PATCH` and `DELETE` requests can be a little difficult to work with, because there is not a lot of HTML support for them. If you haven't used these request types before, you should do some reading and research. Start with these SO questions: [using PUT in HTML form](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8054165/using-put-method-in-html-form) and [PUT vs POST in REST](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/630453/put-vs-post-in-rest)._

## Specifications

#### General
- [ ] All views are rendered on the server using server-side templates written with [Pug][] or [EJS][]
- [ ] Web server can be started with the command `npm start`
- [ ] Test suite can be run with the command `npm test`
- [ ] All features are added as pull requests
- [ ] All pull requests are approved by at least one other member of the team using GitHub's [pull request review feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) (so that your teammate's approval is of the PR is documented)
- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.
- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose
- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.
- [ ] Code is well tested and all tests are passing.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

#### Stories
- [ ] Books have a title, author, and genre
- [ ] Users can add books into the bookstore system via an admin page (_create_)
- [ ] Users can see a list of books on the home page (_read_)

- [ ] Lists of books are always paginated in groups of 10
- [ ] Book detail view is linked to from the listing and search pages
- [ ] Search results are presented in a new page

#### HTTP Verbs
Appropriate HTTP verbs are used for CRUD actions (for reference, follow the guidelines explained in [this article](http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#restful))
- [ ] `GET` requests are only used for _read_ actions
- [ ] `POST` requests are only used for _create_ actions
- [ ] `PUT` or `PATCH` requests are only used for _update_ actions
- [ ] `DELETE` requests are only used for _delete_ actions

### Stretch

- [ ] App is deployed and live on the web (consider using Heroku)
- [ ] All source code is written with ES6
- [ ] Users have their own account and can sign up and sign in/out
- [ ] Users have one of three roles: `admin`, `clerk`, `reader`
- [ ] Users with role `reader` can only view and search for books
- [ ] Users with role `clerk` can edit books in addition to viewing/searching
- [ ] Users with role `admin` can perform all actions (create, read, update, delete) with books
- [ ] Books have a price, cover image, publisher, and ISBN number
