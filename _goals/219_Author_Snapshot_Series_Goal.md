# Author a Series of Snapshot Goals

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Have experience with [Trossello][trossello] or [Florwork][floworky] projects
- Are interested in creating goals that simulate work experience on an OSS project


## Description

Build a series of 3 related snapshot goals based off of [Trossello][trossello] or [Floworky][floworky] codebase.

## Context

A Snapshot goal is based on a medium-to-large-sized repo that is "frozen" in time. It's meant to simulate the experience of developing a feature for an existing "live" open source project.

Use snapshot goals to learn about working with larger code bases, and getting a simulated experience of being in a live sprint to push a set of features across the finish line.

## Specifications

- [ ] All goals closely follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] All three goals in the series work off the same codebase and do not depend on each other
- [ ] Each goal specifically targets a skill group (square) on the [matrix]()
- [ ] Each goal spells out the skill sets it's meant to develop


### Stretch

Use the stretch goals to go deeper into the nuts and bolts of HTTP.

- [ ] Write a fourth related goal
