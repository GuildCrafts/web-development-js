# Dive Into UNIX and Bash

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can open a shell session using a terminal emulator like the Terminal app or iTerm
- Can navigate the filesystem on your computer
- Are familiar with the concept of an operating system
- Are interested in the UNIX family of operating systems
- Are interested in learning how to use your terminal more effectively
- Are interested in being able to write and use shell scripts

## Description

Learn how to navigate your UNIX system like a pro and write scripts with the popular bash scripting language. If you'd like to learn more about how to interact with your operating system and automate common tasks, this is a good goal for you.

This goal will take you through two free online books/tutorials and associated exercises:

- Michael Hartl's book ["Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous"][hartl-command-line]
- Ryan Chadwick's Tutorial on [Bash Scripting][ryans-tutorial-bash-scripting]

There are lots of exercises and activities in each of the books for you to work with. You only have to choose 20 from each to complete the goal. Choose the ones that most interest you, or are closest to your ZPD. Some may be too easy, others too difficult.

If you're really keen, consider doing the stretch specs.

_Note: while the "Learn Enough Command Line" book is free to read online, you have to buy a copy in order to gain access to the official solutions._ ðŸ˜ž _However, this nice person [put their solutions up](https://github.com/scottjoseph/cmd-exercises), in case you're interested in referencing._
