# Topic Benchmarks

## Description

Complete small topic-focused projects from the [collection of topic benchmarks][topic-benchmarks-repo].

The benchmarks are organized into topic directories. Each one should take you roughly 1 day assuming the topic is within your ZPD. If it takes more than a day, you may want to try an easier one.

This goal is meant to be repeated. You will not be able to complete _all_ of the topic benchmarks in one week. With each attempt at this goal, aim to complete 4-5 benchmarks.

Once you complete enough benchmarks to level up, request an assessment.

## Context

This is a benchmark goal and will be used for assessment to determine your level. For more information, read the [Benchmark Goals](https://playbook.learnersguild.org/Learning_Guide/Goals/Benchmark_Goals.html) section of the Playbook.

## Specifications

The benchmarks can be completed in any order. The order provided here is just a suggestion.
