# Topic Benchmarks

## Description

Complete small topic-focused projects from the [collection of topic benchmarks][topic-benchmarks-repo].

The benchmarks are organized into topic directories. Each one should take you roughly 1 day assuming the topic is within your ZPD. If it takes more than a day, you may want to try an easier one.

This goal is meant to be repeated. You will not be able to complete _all_ of the topic benchmarks in one week. With each attempt at this goal, aim to complete 4-5 benchmarks.

Once you complete enough benchmarks to level up, request an assessment.

## Context

These benchmarks will be used for assessment to determine your level. In this way, this is not a normal goal.

Write the best code you can. Write all of the code that you submit. You will be assessed on how well your code meets the specs as well as your comprehension of the code you wrote.

This doesn’t mean that you can’t get help. If you get stuck, ask for support. But because this is an assessment, you should not expect the same level of in-depth support that you get on non-assessment projects.

### Assessment

Once you've completed enough benchmarks to level up, request an assessment.

During your assessment, the assessor will evaluate both your _code_ as well as your _comprehension_ of the skills required.

They will likely ask you to walk through your each file in your code and explain how it works.

To prepare for this assessment, consider the following questions. These may or may not be things the assessor will ask about. You should be prepared to answer any of them.

- How are the project files organized? What does each file do?
- What is the role of this function or subroutine?
- How will the computer read this code?
- Why did you make this design decision?
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- How did you arrive at your solution? Walk through your commit history to show how your solution grew.
