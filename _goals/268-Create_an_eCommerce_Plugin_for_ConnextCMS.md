# GOAL_TITLE

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Are comfortable jumping into an unfamiliar codebase (or four) and finding your way.
- Have a solid understanding of Node and Express, and at least a passing familiarity with MongoDb.
- Are comfortable with navigating an MVC file structure.
- Want to stretch yourself and test your ability to ship a fully-featured feature within a week.
- Want to gain exposure to Backbone.js


## Description

The finished product should be a plugin for ConnextCMS which adds e-commerce functionality.

## Context

This goal is designed to give you a taste of full stack development.  You will interact with both client-side and server-side code with the aim of building a useful tool for users.  This goal also provides the opportunity to contribute to an open source project.

## Specifications

- [ ] Admin users can enter products into a database, categorize them and keep track of their inventory.
- [ ] Customers can add products to a cart, and check out when finished (presuming cash on delivery as the only payment method for now).
- [ ] `/shop` path displays all products, sortable by category
- [ ] Data about the number and value of sales is captured and displayed in the admin dashboard.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license] unless there's potential for it to really make money, in which case it should be released under a goal-writer-gets-50% license, obviously.

## Quality Rubric

- Code is concise and easy to understand [34]
- Plugin is easy to set up, even for a non-coder. (Just run merge and go!) [33]
- Features are implemented in such a way that they are intuitive to use for both types of users (Customers and Admin). [33]

## Resources

[Keystone's]: http://keystonejs.com/docs/ documentation, google group, and github issues are all great resources.

[ConnextCMS]: https://github.com/skagitpublishing/ConnextCMS/wiki has a relatively helpful wiki when it comes to setting up the repo. The documentation is less helpful during actual development.
