# Your Portfolio Site

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can use Google to find relevant resources
- Are around your 30th week
- Have mostly completed at least 2 projects that would serve well as portfolio pieces

## Description

Create a good lookin' portfolio / resume site to help you get a job! Highlight your most impressive projects. To complete this goal, you'll need to have links to at least 2 live projects so part of your week might be spent cleaning up old projects and putting them on the internet.

## Specifications

- [ ] Site is hosted (I recommend Heroku or gh-pages)
- [ ] Site prominently features link to your GitHub
- [ ] Site uses a CSS framework
- [ ] Site includes blurbs / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to your most impressive projects (at least 2)
- [ ] Site includes blurbs / links to your open source contributions
- [ ] Site includes social links (like LinkedIn, Twitter, and other places to find you on the internet)
- [ ] Site includes an about page / section with a headshot and bio
- [ ] Your GitHub profile page is cleaned up with clear, descriptive READMEs for the projects you are highlighting

### Optional / Nice to haves

- [ ] Site includes Twitter integration (tweets show up on site)
- [ ] Site includes a blog or a link to your blog
- [ ] Uses a custom domain (I recommend using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)) - this will cost you a little $$
