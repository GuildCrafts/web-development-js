# Study Tool

# An app that helps you study...

I would like to create a flash card app/ study tool app like this one https://www.studyblue.com
 You can create digital flashcards and use them to study and subject of your choice.
# Context

Creating this web application will provide exposure to:
- Express (or other web framework)
- Javascript
- Simple relational database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with SQL practice
- Simple server side templating (to render data retrieved from the database)
- work with CSS animations
# Specifications
- [ ] User can create "flashcards" and organize them into different categories.
- [ ] Each flash card has a "front" and "back" so user can test their knowledge.
- [ ] CRUD on all flash cards.
- [ ] User can test themselves with flashcards (possibly use CSS animations to do this) and record their progress. (see https://www.studyblue.com for example)
# Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
# Quality Rubric
- Interface is user friendly
- User can easily organize flashcards
- Code is well formatted without any linting errors
- Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
- Functions are small and serve a single purpose
- Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure
