# Learner's Toolbox

## Description

You will be an app for storing and displaying a list of the best coding resources that learner's have found. The UI should be intuitive and the user should be able to search for specific types of resources(i.e React, Pug, etc.). It would be ideal for the app to utilize the idm service and allow users to login with their github information. There should also be a process to submit resources.

## Context

The guild is in need of a single place where learner's can find resources, tutorials, etc. And the most efficient thing to do is to create our own. You will be gathering information from other learner's, either through direct communication or echo. All resources will be compiled into a neat, easy to browse format, built for scaling. This resource will be used guild-wide and hopefully grow with future iterations

## Specifications

* Utilize IDM service for authentication
* Users should be able to search for resources
* Any links should pop up in separate windows or tabs
* UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate
* Users should be able to submit resources
* Homepage should include a link to a list of commonly used JS functions/implementations
* Resources should be gathered from current learners

### Required
- [ ] The app contains a thorough list of resources from the guild.
- [ ] All resources include links.
- [ ] App is hosted live on heroku or a similar service.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].
