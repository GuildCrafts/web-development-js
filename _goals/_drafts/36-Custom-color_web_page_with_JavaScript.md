# Custom-color web page with JavaScript

## Description

Different websites and applications allow different features and colors depending on the user's location, name, or other factors. Many of these apps or websites will allow a user to choose to turn the colors on or off, if necessary. For example, the iPhone allows users to change the color of the screen during the evening, and there is a Chrome extension that does the same. Google maps changes colors at night. 
## Context

This goal is important because users like interactivity in the technologies they use. Knowing how to change the colors of a page or app allows for that interactivity and even accessibility for certain users who might need to increase the contrast between the text and background fonts/colors of their own volition. Someone who takes on this project will have to think about the following:
- What are the base colors for the page?
- When does the page change? Depending on a person's name? The first letter of their name? The time of day when they access the app? Or with some other factor?
- Does the user choose the colors they can change the page to, or is it a preset by the creator of the page? 
- What are the different functions in Javascript that can be used to achieve the specifications?
## Specifications
- [ ] Using HTML and CSS, create at least one web page with information on it for a user to read. This could be a current event, a short story, an instruction set, or an about me page, for example.
- [ ] Using Javascript, create a function that allows the text color and the page background color to be changed according to the factors that the creator sets forth.
- [ ] If the user chooses the colors that the page can be, make buttons for the user to choose or cycle through available sets of colors.
- [ ] If the creator of the page does not allow the user to change the colors, create an alert that logs an answer and uses the user's response in order to change the colors.
### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
