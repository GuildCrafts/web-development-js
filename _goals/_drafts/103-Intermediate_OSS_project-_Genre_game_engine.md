# Intermediate OSS project: Genre game engine

## Description

This project will span 2+ weeks.

Week 1: Project setup (target audience: learners who want to maintain a project)
- Determine game type (easy: tic-tac-toe/connect-4, match-3, text-based RPG; medium: idle game, tetrislike; hard: tile-based action/RPG). The game type will inform architecture decisions to the point at which it is the main determining factor of the difficulty level of the project.
- Determine basic engine architecture (3rd party libraries such as Phaser or React? functional vs OO?)
- Produce contributor guidelines
- Plan initial feature set, targeted specifically to devs who are not quite ready for Floworky/Trossello

Subsequent weeks:
- Maintainers and contributors work together in a manner that is generally comparable to one of the current OSS projects.
## Context

There's been a lot of demand for a project that can serve as an intermediate step between foundations and Floworky/Trossello. This project will have two categories of learners involved:
- Maintainers manage the code base. Ideally, this will be 1-2 people whose skills are at the point where they need minimal support from a pro player to feel comfortable taking on a more leadership-intensive role.
- Contributors learn how to work on a more complicated project with an existing code base.
## Specifications

Week 1:
- [ ] Design doc outlining project architecture, goals, timeline
- [ ] README.md describing project, stack, and contributor guidelines
- [ ] Initial setup of infrastructure
- [ ] List desired features as issues in repo

Subsequent weeks:

Maintainers:
- [ ] Lead new contributors through closing at least one issue each; provide code reviews, coding/debugging support, and cog-app opportunities for contributors.

Contributors:
- [ ] Gain familiarity with onboarding into a new code base. Have at least one PR accepted and merged into the main repo by the maintainer(s).
### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Quality Rubric
- Week 1:
  All architecture decisions must have a clear reasoning, even if the decision comes down to personal preference. All such decisions are incorporated into README.md/contributor guidelines. Feedback solicited from at least one pro player and at least three learners, two of whom must not yet have contributed to Floworky or Trossello, and incorporated into design doc.
- Subsequent weeks:
  Maintainers enforce contributor guidelines consistently. No new bugs introduced per PR. Contributors' quality determined by code review/acceptance of PRs.
