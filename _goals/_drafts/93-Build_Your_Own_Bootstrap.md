# Build Your Own Bootstrap

## Description
- Tired of bootstrap templates ðŸ‘Ž  that are so overused it makes the entire world wide web look the same?  
-  Passionate about front end development?
- Ever dreamt of designing web elements like carousels, navbars, jumbotrons, and grids based on your design aesthetic? 
- Have you already built your own web elements in your previous LG projects?

Then this is the project for you! 

You will build your own web elements for the front end and publish that code so it can be npm installed or downloaded and later used by anyone to build their own site. Here is an example of a Bootstrap type site that was built by 4 college kids! [http://materializecss.com/about.html](url)
