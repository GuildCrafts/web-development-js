# Learn SQL and Explore Data Visualization with Chart.js

## Description

#### 1. Complete any combination of these SQL tutorials:
(a) The [Database Foundations course on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/database-foundations) OR
(b) the [Learn SQL track on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-sql) which includes four courses "SQL Basics," "Modifying Data with SQL,"  "Reporting with SQL," and "Querying Relational Databases."  OR
(c) [SQLZoo Tutorials]( http://sqlzoo.net/)

#### 2. Build a SQL database and an app that displays queries to this database to the front end/browser. 

#### 3. (Optional) When you're done with that, explore data visualization options like [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/) and use one of these technologies to visualize your data on the front end.


## Context
This goal gives you the opportunity to learn how to set up a database on back end server, hook it up to a front end/browser, and render your data to the browser.( It is a first step towards learning how to set up CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for a database, as it asks only for implementation of "Read" functionality.) You will also learn how to use technologies like [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/about/), mySQL, or a similar database management system (DBMS) 

Prior to starting this goal, learners should be familiar with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), setting up node_modules and dependencies with[ npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/), setting up a server (i.e., using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and/or Express Generator), and other server side technologies like templating view engines (i.e., [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)). 

Treehouse does have three tutorials that will bring you up to speed: [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics), [NPM Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics), and [Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics) (includes explanation of pug templating). 

### Happy databasing!


## Specifications

- [ ] Complete Database Foundations; or the SQL Basic track (includes SQL Basics, Modifying Data with SQL. Reporting with SQL, and Querying Relational Databases) on Treehouse; and/or the [SQL Zoo Tutorial]( http://sqlzoo.net/).
- [ ] Create a SQL database and import into it a public set of data (Google public fun data sets as in [this article](http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/)), or create your own data set /
- [ ] Build an app that displays data queries from your newly created database!

## Stretch Goals
