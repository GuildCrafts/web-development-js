# Refactor a Previous Project

## Description

The goal is to take a project from a prior week and refactor the code to make it better and more efficient. The project can be any project that any person on the team has worked on. By looking over previous code and rewriting it as well as possibly even adding features to it, the opportunity to learn is great. Plus there is the added benefit of making a project that you have contributed to even better for your portfolio.
## Context

Refactoring code is a great excercise to understand how the program works as well as an opportunity to make the existing code base more efficient and better.
## Specifications
- [ ] Refactor Code
- [ ] Organize the file system to be clearer and more concise
- [ ] Make code reusable
- [ ] Functions should serve a single purpose
- [ ] Add new features that are relevant
### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Quality Rubric
- Code is well formatted without any linting errors
- Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
- Functions are small and serve a single purpose
- Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure
- Code is reasonably tested with a test suite
  Interface is user friendly
