# Blogetty-blog-blog: Make A Blog Site

## Description
Make a scalable, single page blog app, and make it responsive, BEAUTIFUL and/or INNOVATIVE!

## Context
Learners research award winning, innovative blog designs and use wireframing to pre-visualize their app and put some thought into their desired user experience.  Learners will gain practice templating to render blog posts as different page views of a single page app. Learners will gain practice setting up a server using Express and/or Express-generator, and templating using Pug (or Handlebars, or equivalent). 

Optional: Learners will set up a backend database such as SQL/Postgres. Learners will implement CRUD for their database so they can Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.

### An excellent way to learn how to set up a single page app that renders different information from a data file or database. Great for Learners who have blog content to share with the world, or are planning on writing a blog and creating a blog site. Here's your chance to make it exactly as you want!

Below, a set of recommended tutorials on Treehouse that take you through most of this process:
* Prework: [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics), [NPM Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics)
* [Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics) (includes explanation of pug templating). This tutorial uses building a blog site as its main example, so it takes you through most of the server-side work! ***
* Optional for those wishing to add a database to their blog site: [SQL Basics track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-sql) that includes four courses "SQL Basics," "Modifying Data with SQL,"  "Reporting with SQL," and "Querying Relational Databases."

## Specifications
- [ ] Wireframe of app that puts thought into excellent user experience to be implemented. Research existing blog websites that look and work great, or that are totally out-of-the-box design wise, then sketch (by hand or use a tool like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) ) your app's look and functionality, page by page. Have fun making it yours!
- [ ] Optimize your assets on the front-end (your images should be web-ready, for example)
- [ ] Use responsive design principles (make it mobile first!)

User should be able to:

- [ ] Navigate back to the home page at any time.

### Stretch Goals

- [ ] User should be able to filter by a tag/topic and get a page that displays all the blog posts that have this topic as a tag
- [ ] User can easily share a blog post on social media via social media buttons
#### Stretch goals requiring the use of database (CRUD functionality):
- [ ] Edit blog post 
- [ ] Delete blog post
