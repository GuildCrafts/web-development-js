# Create an Algorithm To Cultivate A Perfect Magic The Gathering Deck

## Description

Magic the Gathering fans: this would be a great chance to cultivate a perfect deck.
## Context

For n00bs and pros alike, we have one thing in common: our playing styles are unique. How will you find what cards you need for your playing style? 

This would be immensely useful because it could help you figure out what cards you need to start an initial deck or supplement an existing one. Plus it could give you great information if you wanted to do something differently.

It will question your playing style and get you excited about collecting(again)!
