# Mapping Oakland's Potholes and Current Paving Contracts

## Description

_Provide a brief, high-level overview of what the final product (artifact) of this goal is. Include any relevant resources or dependencies here._

_The point is to map out the city's pothole's using the data from the city and compare that with the current paving contracts that the city has. It would give an opportunity to measure the city's ability to maintain the steets. It would also give user the ability to see where there are potholes and/ or construction via a map that they can use._
## Context

_Why is this goal important? How is it useful? What questions will it raise?_

_It would give developers an ability to link data using API's and create a map _

_It is useful to the city and citizens' because it would give a visual overview of the data provided, as well as give the city a metric to compare and analyze it's ability to maintain the city's streets._

_A good question to keep in mind is how can we add an algorythm that would measure the data provided, in terms of the city's ability to address its problems with potholes._
## Specifications

_List of specifications (specs) for the completed goal. These are declarative sentences (statements) describing some quality or behavior of the final product._
- [ ] Grab Data from the city of Oakland through its APIs via https://data.oaklandnet.com/.
- [ ] Find a way to render that data on a map, perhaps via GoogleMaps API, and keep it up to date in real time.
- [ ] Have a simple and easy to understand display for all the information and the data on the map.
- [ ] Be able to search specific locations in the map and navigate with the map by avoiding the potholes and current and future construction zones.
- [ ] Make it Mobile Friendly (Stretch Goal?)
- [ ] Create an algorithm that would compare and measure the two data sets, the potholes and the city's current paving contracts. (Stretch Goal?)
### Required

_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
