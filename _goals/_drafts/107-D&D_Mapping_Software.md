# D&D Mapping Software

## Description
Gridmapper is an open source simple dungeon map making software written by Alex Schroeder. Currently, the code has a few bugs. Letâ€™s rebuild it and make it bette!
Original here: https://campaignwiki.org/gridmapper.svg
Original repo here: https://github.com/kensanata/gridmapper
Bonus: blog of the person who wrote it https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Gridmapper

## Context

This goal is useful because you get to work from an existing code base and modernize it. You can either rebuild the app, or you can try and improve the existing features. 

This goal uses SVG for the map icons, so that's cool. If you're not interested in drawing your own icons with SVG, you can use the SVG code for the icons which is included in the original repo. Here is my in-progress repo where I am currently attempting to separate the files: https://github.com/lizzkats/Gridmapper

## Specifications

## Quality Rubric

_What are some appropriate quality objectives for this goal? These are statements about the internal characteristics of the product that demonstrate fine design and craftspersonship, not its external features._
