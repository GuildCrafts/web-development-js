# Greater Bay Area Movie Theater App

## Description

Create a web app that connects to Google Maps, with a search bar that looks specifically for movie theaters in the Bay Area. Use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and you may also implement databases or other libraries to help you gather the information for these theaters. The information that will be collected and displayed to the user should include, film showtimes, reviews, theater reviews (i.e. customer service, environment, the behavior of other patrons, etc).

You should still write the code for the site, including creating the space for the plugins and you must be able to explain all of your choices for third party software. 

Do not publish this site, just use the html index for us to access for review at the end of the cycle. 
## Context

As a user, when I visit a page about movie theaters, I want a clean and simple interface, a way to save my favorite theater, my payment info, and my preferred genre. Create a site that allows that, and does so with a map interface, when the page loads up though, the user wants nothing more than a postal code, so that they can begin as simply as possible. 

Creating an interactive web app that accesses large databases for your specific website use is a great way to understand the concept of full stack development, since you will definitely need to access the skills on multiple languages and frameworks. This project in particular would help the end user with accessing information about new release films, which has become a popular pastime. 

Feel free to use frameworks and other libraries, but do not copy-paste, it is crucial that in typing the code out allows you to continually read and discover how the code works. The exception would be for plug-ins or pathways to accessing large datasets.

As you code your site, you will likely encounter scenarios that you may not have expected, which is fine, it only means that you given more opportunities to problem-solve!
## Specifications
- [ ] When the site loads up, I want a map to appear and a way where I just enter my zip code and then the map automatically transports me to the theaters closest to me.
- [ ] When I click on a theater location, I just want a theater photo, information, customer rating (for the theater), price rating ($ - $$$$), and a button to click through to current showtimes. 
- [ ] I want a  service that saves credit card info, preferred theater, and preferred film genre. 
- [ ] Please make sure everything loads for me, thanks!
- [ ] If you use any frameworks or code libraries, please cite them and/or explain how you implemented them in a gitbook, or on your README.
- [ ] Bonus: Optimize for Mobile.
