# JustUs

# Build a Mobile App That Would Provide Resources for People Going Through a Medical or Mental Health Crisis

### *** Must have knowledge of:
- CRUD operations
- Express
- SQL (Postgres)
- Javascript fundamentals, including ES6 features
- NEED TO KNOW REACT is highly recommended. (or be prepared for a high learning curve)
- Reflux is on this project and has a very high learning curve...be prepared
- MUST KNOW Testing frameworks

## Description
- Give people alternatives to calling 911 when they, or someone around them are in particular types of crisis 
- Work towards decoupling access to health care from policing
- This information would be provided via crowdsourcing resources for trained responders(not police) from communities directly

## User Story
- A web application build with React.js, Express, Node, Postgres, Sequelize ORM
- We are building a web application app that would have two parts:
- First is a forum that would allow users to share resources. Other users can comment as well as and up vote, or down vote, different suggestions for resources.
- Second is a section that users can easily access when in crisis, with the click of a button. When needed, the top 3-5 up-voted resources are rendered, along with phone numbers for easy access in an emergency.
- Resources are rendered for user's geographical location
- Front end is designed mobile-first

- Stretch goal is to eventually build this a mobile application, that would utilize location services with the ability to work in multiple regions

## Background Work
- [ ] Reaching out to already existing groups that are organizing on this issue to partner with:  http://criticalresistance.org/chapters/cr-oakland/the-oakland-power-projects/
  https://occupypublichealth.wordpress.com/about/sfbayarea/ 
  https://www.1degree.org/

*\* Please offer up suggestions of other organizations that may be good to reach out to...

### Quality
- This is an open source.
- all code must be neatly formatted and organized so ensure other can easily collaborate and work with this code base
- Each spec committed to must be issued in a single PR and undergo a code review before it will be merged into the project. 
- Specs are counted as "completed" as if their PR is merged.

### Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).



### Please comment with feedback on this goal. If people are serious about building this application lets put in the time outside of LG hours to move this goal out of draft!
