# Technical Freedom - Structureless Work

## Challenge Rating

This goal is designed for those who have a good grasp of the basics of web development. That means, you are COMFORTABLE working with:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, some SQL or NoSQL database language, testing using Mocha/Chai, Jasmine, Axios, Moxios.

The comfort level is self-determined. This goal requires honesty with one's own technical drive.

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Are self-driven
- Work well without structure
- Can guide yourself
- Know what you need to learn to maximize your own education

## Description

In this goal, you will either:

- work on a technical project that's intended to be included in your resume. This will likely be a multi-week adventure.

OR

- deep dive into the knowledge-gaps you have self-identified in your web development education so you may build a technical project as stated above.

This goal is intended to be repeatable.

## Context

For those of you who learn optimally without structure, this goal is designed to give you freedom to pursue what will accelerate your education. The specs will be easy to meet, thus eliminating the need to focus on completion. Dive in, have fun, focus on the joy of coding.

'Cracking the Coding Interview', a best-selling book by Gayle McDowell, recommends having 2-3 of technical projects that you can discuss in depth in your interviews. It's great way to have show experience for us less experienced programmers. So the intention of this goal is to guide learners toward that end.

CAUTION: If you don't learn well without structure, this goal is NOT for you.

NOTE: This goal can be done solo or with a team of up to 4 learners. If you want to work on a project in a team, find others and go for it.

## Specifications

- [ ] Identify 1-3 technical projects you want to build.
- [ ] Identify a tech stack to getting those project(s) completed.
- [ ] Work on implementing technical projects or filling in knowledge-gaps.
