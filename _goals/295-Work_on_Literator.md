## Description

[Literator][] is developing a great product for public schools and teachers to utilize technology in the classroom to track and improve literacy rates.

Literator's core values are improving equity in education and providing a high-quality tool for educators created by a public school teacher with the teacher's needs in mind.

Literator's stack:

- Backend API using Python & Django
- Mobile apps for iOS using Objective C and Android using Java
- Web services with React/Webpack/Fluxxor

This goal is a chance to work on Literator's web services with active support and mentorship from their CTO Jeff Tchang. You would be working remotely with in-person support one to two days a week from Jeff.

For more information, read the [project proposal][].

## Context

This is not a drill. This the real tamale.

If you choose this goal, you'll be working for an external client (i.e. not someone within Learners Guild) on a live, in-production codebase.

Only choose this goal if you are ready and willing to commit to multiple weeks of work in a new codebase with less support available. Because the technology is not managed by Learners Guild, there is no guarantee that coaches will be able to support you. You will likely need to figure out a lot of things on your own.

This is a great goal for testing your skills in a "live" remote development environment. It will be fun. It will not be easy.

## Specifications

Specs will be determined at project start time.
