# Week 1 Onboarding

## Introduction

Welcome to your first week at Learners Guild! We're excited to have you.

Remember to **take your time.** No need to rush. If you are feeling overwhelmed or confused: take a breath, get up and stretch, ask someone for help, and/or take a break.

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Are in your first week at Learners Guild!

## Description

This onboarding goal will walk you through obtaining skills that will help set you up to be successful for your time here at Learners Guild. For this first week, you won't be expected to produce any artifacts, which is not generally the case. You will learn about creating artifacts in your second week here.
