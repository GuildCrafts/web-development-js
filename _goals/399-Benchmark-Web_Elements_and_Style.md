# Benchmark: Web Elements & Style

This is a **beginner** integration benchmark goal.

## Description

Build your own [style guide][wiki-style-guide] with good [accessibility][wiki-web-accessibility] features based on the guidlines established by the [A11Y Style Guide](http://a11y-style-guide.com/).

To complete this project, you'll be writing HTML and CSS to create a style guide similar to the example A11Y style guide: http://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/.

You can either choose to mimic the default styles provided by A11Y or modify it to suit your own design ideas.
