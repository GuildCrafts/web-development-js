# Timeoff Snapshot [International Epic]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Have built simple CRUD apps with node.js
- Interested in tackling a bigger challenge involving a more complex codebase
- Have some familiarity with testing web apps
- Have already worked on a previous Epic on this codebase

## Description

A Snapshot goal is based on a medium-to-large-sized repo that is "frozen" in time. It's meant to simulate the experience of developing a feature for an existing "live" open source project.
Use snapshot goals to learn about working with larger code bases, and getting a simulated experience of being in a live sprint to push a set of features across the finish line.

This repo is a Timeoff Manager which is used by small to medium sized companies to manage requests for time off by it's employees.

# Context

Having learned the basics of CRUD apps, you'll spend as much time reading code as writing it, and having to design creative solutions within a legacy codebase.

## Specifications


- [ ] Complete all user stories in the [Epic 3: International Support][repo].

- [ ] Practice an Agile approach to developing this epic:
  - All user stories are added as issues to github (in your fork of timeoff.management) and tracked there
  - Start a [project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-projects/) in github, add all user stories to it, and drag one issue at a time from the `backlog` to `in progress`
  - Every user story should be in its own clean pull request, with unit and integration tests included. PRs should not span multiple user stories, and user stories should not span multiple PRs
  - Practice a daily standup with your pair: "what we worked on yesterday, what we are accomplishing today, what's blocking"
- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.
- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.
- [ ] Code is well formatted with proper spacing and indentation.
- [ ] Where appropriate, comments explain unusual code, bug fixes, code assumptions.
- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.
- [ ] Methods are grouped logically or by accessibility. Basic separation of code into logical folders.

### Stretch

- [ ] Complete all five user stories in the [Epic 4: Date Formats][repo]
