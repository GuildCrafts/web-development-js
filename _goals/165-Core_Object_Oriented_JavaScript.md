# Core Object Oriented JavaScript

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can write correct JavaScript and understand its syntax
- Can read and write JavaScript control structures, basic functions, and data types
- Are interested in JavaScript scopes and closures
- Are interested in the `this` keyword in JavaScript
- Are interested in prototype delegation and inheritance
- Are interested in code reuse

## Description

A day-by-day structured deep dive into object-oriented JavaScript. Read articles, watch videos, complete lessons and exercises, and implement a final project.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), books like [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net), and various [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8wwnhdkPE4).

Fork the the [core-object-oriented-javascript repository][core-oojs] and use the fork as your project artifact.

In the [README.md][core-oojs-readme] you'll find that this goal is broken down into daily objectives and tasks in order to support you in pacing yourself. There are a ton of stretch goals at the end, so make sure to go with the recommended pace, or faster to get the most out of it.

## Context

While JavaScript is not a strictly object-oriented language, it does have lots of interesting object-oriented features.

Becoming a fluent JS developer means having an intimate knowledge with the particularities of the JS object model, with things like `this` and constructor functions and prototypes... It's a different way of structuring code from the classical model.

Choose this goal if you've wondered how objects work in JavaScript and are looking to immerse yourself in an intensive and highly structured study.
