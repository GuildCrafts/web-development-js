# Core Data Structures [Basic]

This is a sub-goal of [Core Data Structures][core-ds].

Use the same specifications & quality rubric as in [Core Data Structures][core-ds], but complete **ONLY** the [Basic Data Structures][list-basic-ds] from the list, not the [Advanced][list-advanced-ds]. That's a [separate goal][core-ds-advanced]. :)
