# Core Data Structures [Basic]

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm
- Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts
- Are familiar with the interfaces of core JavaScript objects: Object, Array, String, etc.
- Are interested in common data structures
- Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving

## Description

This is a sub-goal of [Core Data Structures][core-ds]. Reference that goal for more description, context, and resources.

Complete **ONLY** the [Basic Data Structures][list-basic-ds] from the list, not the [Advanced][list-advanced-ds]. That's a [separate goal][core-ds-advanced]. :)

## Specifications

- [ ] Artifact produced is a fork of the [core-data-structures][core-data-structures] repo.
- [ ] Can run all tests with `npm test`.
- [ ] All tests are passing.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Node` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Linked List` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Linked List`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Stack` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Stack`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Queue` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Queue`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Queue` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Queue`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Priority Node` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Priority Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Doubly-Linked List` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Doubly-Linked List`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Double Node` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Double Node`.
- [ ] A working implementation of the `Set` data structure is complete.
- [ ] Unit tests exist for all methods of `Set`.
 structure.
- [ ] Repository includes a README file with basic installation and setup instructions.
- [ ] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.
- [ ] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.
- [ ] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.
- [ ] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.
- [ ] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].

### Stretch

Pick a _different_ programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each data structure identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with unit tests for each method and property _in a language other than JavaScript_.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the data structure _in a language other than JavaScript_.
