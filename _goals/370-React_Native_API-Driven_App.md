# React Native API-Driven App

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Have done at least 2 projects using React
- Have contributed to and our built Node.js web apps
- Are interested in how to build and start a React-Native app
- Are interested in how to start a cross platform development environment (iOS/Android)
- Are interested in how to utilize React-Native's fetch method and/or additional libraries to pull third-party API data

## Description

#### We are building a React Native Search App that utilizes a third party API to fetch data and uses components to render the data. This goal introduces you to the fundamentals of mobile development utilizing a language you have familiarity with. There is no need to adopt Swift or Objective C!

**Step 1** - [Refer to this scafflod repo](https://github.com/pllearns/react-native-starter-code)

Then create your own repo and follow the `readme` instructions on the repo.

**Step 2** - Find a third-party API to play with

Suggestions:
- [OMDB Api](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
- [Yelp Api](https://www.yelp.com/developers)

## Context

You want to build an app with a simple UI. Stay away from too many form fields, and keep the components' state management minimal. This is a great project if you want to jump start your skills in mobile development. The resources listed below specifications will help you understand the benefits of using React Native to develop in the mobile space. 

## Specifications

- [ ] __10:__ You have an app component that feeds both android and iOS js files
- [ ] __10:__ You can start the app with both `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android`
- [ ] __10:__ You have at least 3 tests written using `jest` 
- [ ] __10:__ You have a home page that contains at least one touchable navigation button 
- [ ] __10:__ You have at least one extra screen to navigate to with rendered data 
- [ ] __10:__ Your rendered data is minimal in design and clean 
- [ ] __10:__ Your code is clean, and components are explicity named and have minimal responsibilities
- [ ] __50:__ You are able to render third API data through navigating to a separate screen (example: a search button that `onClick` takes you to a results page.
- [ ] __30:__ You have a complete `readme` that documents how to start your app and set up the dev environment *hint: the scaffold repo will start you in the right direction*
- [ ] __30:__ You are properly protecting sensitive API ids and secret keys using `config` or `env`
