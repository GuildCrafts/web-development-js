# Postalicious - Demystifying HTTP

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can build basic websites with HTML & CSS
- Can build simple apps and scripts with Node.js and npm
- Have set up a web server with Node.js and Express
- Are familiar with the concept of web servers and clients
- Are interested in understanding the web at a deeper level
- Are interested in learning more about HTTP

## Description

Build a loose clone of the [Postman extension][postman-extension] for Google Chrome. Let's go early aughts style and call it... _Postalicious_.

Postalicious is an app that lets you send custom HTTP requests to a server and inspect both the request and the response messages. In this way, it lets you control things like request parameters, headers, and the message body, and then you can see the raw response from the server.

Here's a wireframe of the Postalicious interface that you can use to design around:

![postalicious](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/709100/23727389/d4195ca8-0425-11e7-8a02-fe42d4938b9a.png)

In order to give Postalicious something to practice on, you'll also build a simple HTTP server using Node.js and [Express][express] (we'll just call this the "sandbox server"). This server won't do much, but it will provide a range of response to different kinds of requests so that your Postalicious app has a good sandbox to play with.

If you are brand-new to HTTP, or just a little rusty, it is highly recommended that you go through some or all of the [courses and tutorials](#courses-and-tutorials) in the [resources](#resources) section. Don't limit yourself to just these resources — there are lots of good learning materials on the web — but these at least should put you on more solid footing.

It is recommended that you build the sandbox server first, and then the Postalicious app after.

Finally, as a stretch exercise, use Postalicious to send requests to a real-world web API.

## Context

HTTP is what makes the web work. Well, it's part of what makes the web work. Knowing what it is and how it works is important for any web developer, because it makes everything else that is built _on top of_ HTTP easier to understand, debug, and make sense of.

In this goal, you'll become familiar with terms like `request`, `response`, `client`, `server`, `status code`, `protocol`, `header`, `body`, and `HTTP verb`. You'll also have to deal with the parts of a `URL` (Uniform Resource Locator): the `protocol`, `host`, `port`, (resource) `path`, and `query`.

That may sound like a lot of vocabulary words. It is. But these are the building blocks of the web - if you don't know what they mean, this is a perfect opportunity to find out!

The good news is that HTTP is really not hard to work with - it's built to be human-readable. The following message is an abridged, but not unrelated, version  to what your browser sends every time you search for "hedgehog" on Google:

```http
GET /search?q=hedgehog HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html

```

Let's break that down quickly and put some of those vocabulary words to use. If you read it left-to-right, top-to-bottom, it can be interpreted like this:

> (1st line): Send a **request** using the GET method/**verb** to the **path** `/search` with a **query** string containing one key `q` having the value `hedgehog`, using version `1.1` of the hypertext transfer protocol (**HTTP**).
> <br>(2nd line): In the **header**, specify the **host** to send this request to the **server** at `www.google.com`\*.
> <br>(3rd line): Include a user agent key in the **header** to identify the **client** as a Chrome browser operating on a Mac computer running OSX 10.12.3.
> <br>(4th line): Use the accept key in the **header** with the value `text/html` to tell the server which content types (also called [MIME types][list-mime-types]) the client can understand so that it sends the appopriate type in the **body** of the **response** message.
> <br>(5th line): Leave a blank line to signal the end of the **message**.

_\*Implied in this message is the fact that this request will be sent to **port** 80 because this is the default for HTTP requests._

If that all sounds like ancient Greek to you, never fear. If you take it one step at a time and dive into each concept, experiment with it in your code, and do your proper research, you'll get to a place where the above makes perfect sense.

### Stretch

Use the stretch goals to go deeper into the nuts and bolts of HTTP.

- [ ] Sandbox server is written using _only the core Node.js modules_ (instead of Express, use the built-in [HTTP module][node-http]).
- [ ] Users of Postalicious can "save" their requests in a history panel
- [ ] Clicking on a saved request will re-load it into the form
- [ ] Using Postalicious, create some HTTP requests to various real-world APIs:
  - [ ] Get all issues for a repo through the GitHub API
  - [ ] Get all tweets with the hashtag `#javascript` with the Twitter API
  - [ ] Any other API request(s) of your choice
  - [ ] External HTTP requests are saved in files under a `example-requests/` directory (make sure to obscure any secure information before saving these files, like your password or authentication token)
