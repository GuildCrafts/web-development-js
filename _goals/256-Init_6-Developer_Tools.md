# Init 6: Developer Tools

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Have completed several goals
- Have used git and GitHub to do basic version control and project management tasks
- Can read and write JavaScript
- Are interested in becoming more effective with your developer tools and environment

## Description

Learn to use your developer tools and environment more efficiently and effectively.

This goal has no "project" output associated with it. Instead, the specs are grouped by skill.

As you work through the specs, you'll be improving your skills in areas like:

- Debugging
- Git
- GitHub
- Code Editor
- Pairing
- Typing

Make use of the [resources](#resources) for each section.

Pay attention to the **terms & concepts** highlighed in **bold**. By the end of the goal, you should have a better idea of what they mean and how to use them. In other words, aim to be able to answer the question "what is X?" for yourself.

## Context

The series of initiation goals are designed for new members of Learners Guild to get oriented to the learning environment, build key foundational skills, and work on some fun projects.

1. [Init 1: Bossggle Word Game][bossggle-word-game]
1. [Init 2: OOP Practice with Bike Shop][bike-shop-oop]
1. [Init 3: Hello Web Servers][hello-web-servers]
1. [Init 4: Relational Databases][relational-databases]
1. [Init 5: Web APIs][web-apis]
1. [Init 6: Developer Tools][developer-tools]

This is the final goal in the series! Congratulations! You've made it through quite a lot. Once you've finished this goal, you'll have built a solid foundation of essential skills that you'll build upon as you continue learning JavaScript web development.

In this goal, you'll be working on building fluency with your tools and your working environment. As a web developer, your computer is primary workspace. The tools you use every day (editors, shell programs, packages, etc.) make up your development environment, shaping how you work and what you are able to do.

It is important to know how to configure this environment and use these tools and continuously modify and upgrade it so that your workspace works _for_ you. Just like carpenters have to keep their shop clean and their tools organized in order to work most effectively, web developers must do the same with their space and tools.

## Specifications

These are the basic specs for "Developer Tools". If you complete these specs, try taking on some of the [Stretch specs](#stretch).

You don't have to complete these specs in any particular order.

### General

- [ ] Artifact produced is a gist with a Markdown file containing links and text

### Level Up your Debugging

To be a great programmer, you need to be a great debugger. This means both being able to _think analytically_ as well as being able to use _debugging tools_.

At the least, you should be able to:

- Read **backtraces**
- **Log** values with `console.log()`
- Log backtraces with `console.trace()`
- Use a **debugger** to set **break points**
- Use a debugger to step up and down the **call stack**
- Use a debugger to **evaluate code** at a specific points

Starting with the [Debugging Resources](#debugging), learn as much as you can about debugging tools for JavaScript and practice on your own code.

- [ ] Artifact includes a list of 3+ debugging tools that you found especially useful

### Get Good at Git and GitHub

Pick one of your repositories that has a decent amout of code and git history already and create a copy of it to use as a "sandbox" environment for learning about git and GitHub. To create a "sandbox" copy of your repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub to put the copy into (we'll use the placeholder `SANDBOX_REPO` here)
2. Clone the original repository and move into it
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB/YOUR_REPO.git SANDBOX_REPO
  ...
  $ cd SANDBOX_REPO
  ```
3. Change the remote location to the new repo
  ```
  $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB/SANDBOX_REPO.git
  ```
4. Push the code to the remote repo
  ```
  $ git push origin master
  ```

- [ ] Sandbox **GitHub repository** is created and linked to in the artifact
- [ ] Sandbox repo includes a `.gitignore` file with at least a few patterns included
- [ ] Sandbox repo has at least one **pull request**

Artifact contains the **git commands** you used to...
- [ ] **clone** a remote repository
- [ ] **stage** and unstage files for commit
- [ ] create a **commit** with a **commit message**
- [ ] **amend** the most recent commit message
- [ ] create and delete **branches**
- [ ] **push** to a remote repository
- [ ] **pull** a **feature branch** from a remote repository
- [ ] push a **local branch** to a specific remote branch
- [ ] **revert** files back to a specific commit
- [ ] **rebase** a branch onto master
- [ ] interactively rebase using the `--interactive` flag to squash, rename, and reorder commits
- [ ] move specific commits between different branches with the `cherry-pick` command

### Type Faster and Better

Boost your typing skills. Practice as much as you canâ€”being able to type quickly and efficiently is an essential skill.

This is a great activity for when you need to give your brain a rest from more cognitively straining activities.

Here are a couple of resources for you to use, but don't be limited to them if you find better ones:

- [Typing.io][typing-io] - built for programmers. Not too many options in the free edition, but a good place to practice typing _code_, not just plain English.
- [Typing Club][typingclub] - lots of practice and lessons for all levels. They start you off at the very beginning, but you can jump ahead to any lesson and test yourself.

- [ ] Artifact cites your best WPM (words per minute) score from Typing.io

### Practice Pair Programming

Learn some techniques and tools for **pair programming** and try them out with your teammate.

At the least, you should be able to:

- Follow the roles of **driver** and **navigator** when pair programming
- Pair on the same computer
- **Pair remotely** with ScreenHero

Check out the links in the [Pair Programming](#pair-programming) section of the [Resources](#resources).

There is no "completion" spec for this section.

### Master your Editor

Your **code editor** should be as familiar to you as your bedroom. You should know where things live, what they do, and how to use them.

Find some resources about your code editor of choice and spend time learning about the different things your editor can do.

If you aren't using a code editor that allows for **plugins** or extensions, you're missing out. The best editors have a plugin system so that developers can extend them to do all kinds of nifty things.

Check out the links in the [Editor Extensions and Plugins](#editor-extensions-and-plugins) section of the [Resources](#resources) to find packages for your editor of choice.

- [ ] Artifact contains a list of 3+ features of your editor that you discovered
- [ ] Artifact contains a list of your favorite editor plugins

### Setup Homebrew and Install Some Packages

[Homebrew][homebrew] is a useful tool for managing software and packages/libraries on a Mac. If you don't have it already, set it up!

Then, use the [homebrew-bundle][homebrew-bundle] package to create your own `Brewfile` to keep track of all your installed **Homebrew packages**. You may want to add this file to your `dotfiles` repo.

- [ ] A `Brewfile` with your favorite Homebrew packages is linked from the artifact

### Stretch

### Make Your Own Dotfiles

Dotfiles are usually **configuration files** for things like your shell, languages, and packages. Many developers keep all their dotfiles organized in one repo.

Check out the links in the [Dotfiles & Environment Management](#dotfiles-environment-management) section of the [Resources](#resources) for more information and lots of examples of other dotfiles repos. One way to go is to fork a dotfiles repo that you like, and then customize it according to your preferences.

- [ ] Dotfiles repo exists in your personal GitHub account
- [ ] Artifact includes link to dotfiles repo

### Build an Atom Package

The Atom editor has a robust package management system. And, you can write them in JavaScript. :smile:

If you don't have an idea for a package that you'd like to build, you could find one that you like and reverse-engineer it. Also, you could do this [tutorial on building an Atom plugin][tutorial-atom-plugin].

- [ ] Installable Atom package is published as a repo on your personal GitHub account
- [ ] Artifact includes link to Atom package repo
