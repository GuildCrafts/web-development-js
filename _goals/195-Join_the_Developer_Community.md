# Join the Developer Community

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can use a terminal & shell to interact with and navigate the filesystem
- Can use Google to find relevant learning resources
- Are familiar with package managers like npm
- Are interested in improving and configuring your development environment
- Are interested in getting involved with the software development community

## Description

Improve your development environment - both on your computer and in the social world of software development!

In this goal, you'll complete a set of mini-projects to help you **get involved** with your local (and online) **developer community**.

You'll get to do things like contribute to an open source project, discover interesting conferences and meetups, and find publish your personal website.

### Mini-Projects

Each of these mini-projects should take between 2-6 hours. The output of each mini-project will vary based on the type of project. Make sure to include a link to each output in your artifact.

After you complete each project, consider sharing your findings/learnings with other learners! Lots of people will likely benefit from what you discover.

#### Contribute to Open Source [Community]

Find an open source project that you are interested in, fork it, pick an open issue, resolve it, and then open a pull request.

Getting started with open source can be a bit daunting or intimidating, but luckily there are lots of good resources out there to help you out. Check out the links in the [Open Source](#open-source) section of the [Resources](#resources).

**Output:** make a pull request on an open-source project. Link to the PR in your artifact.

#### Publish your Personal Website



**Output**: publish your own website using Google Pages. Link to the published site in your artifact.

#### Find and Join some Meetups and Workshops [Community]

[Meetups][meetup] are a great way to connect with other people in your industry, learn about new projects and technologies, share knowledge, and find work opportunities. Workshops can also be good places to learn a new skill and build community, but sometimes they can be costly.

**Output:** compile a list of good Meetups and/or workshops with links. If you attend any of them, include your thoughts/reflections.

#### Find and Follow Industry Thought Leaders [Community]

Discover interesting folks to follow on Twitter, Medium, and other social media sites. This is a good way to find inspirational folks and maybe even make a new friend or two. :)

To get you started, here are a few folks from my list that I'd recommend: [Anil Dash](https://twitter.com/anildash), [Erica Joy](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy), and [Vanessa Hurst](https://twitter.com/DBNess).

**Output:** compile a list of interesting people to follow, along with links to their social media profile(s).

#### Discover Industry Conferences [Community]

Some love them, some hate them, but for better or worse conferences are a big part of the social sphere in tech and they can be a good place to meet people and build community. Unfortunately, many conferences are really expensive. However, companies are often willing to fund their employees to go to conferences. Some conferences even offer discounts and scholarships for people who would otherwise not be able to attend.

Here are few good conferences I'm aware of (haven't had the chance to attend, but I've heard good things from trusted people): [AlterConf](https://alterconf.com/), [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/), and [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/).

**Output:** compile a list of relevant and useful conferences. If you attend any of them, include your thoughts/reflections.



## Context

Like most industries, the social environment of web and software development is complex. Sometimes, it can be intimidating to know how to engage with other developers to make connections, create a network, and find mentorship or support. Also, the tech industry in the US has plenty of problems with systematic discrimination in the form of racism, sexism, classism, ablism, cissexism, and others.

Figuring out how to find and build a supportive, nurturing, and safe community within the industry is important for all web developers at the start of their career. This goal is intended to help you better orient and understand the larger community and to find out how and where to make your place within it.
