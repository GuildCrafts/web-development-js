# Trossello Snapshot: Members & Teams Epic

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can build CRUD apps from scratch with Node.js and PostgreSQL
- Can use React to build stateful client-side applications
- Have worked with SASS stylesheets
- Have worked on a snapshot goal and/or with the Trossello codebase
- Are familiar with SQL and SQL query writers like Knex.js
- Are interested in working within a more complex, real-world codebase

## Description

Starting at commit [`d177114`][starting-commit], implement **board + card members** in the [Trossello][trossello] app.

If you are **new to snapshot goals or to the Trossello app**, you may want to try a slightly easier one first, like the [Labels Epic][labels-epic]. Read the [Context](#context) section to learn whether this project will be right for you.

To complete this goal, you'll be mimicking features of the real Trello app. To do this, you'll need to use good reverse-engineering skills:

- Try out the feature for yourself
- Note how it works in detail
- Track what happens in response to different inputs

In the Trello app, boards can have "members". Board members are other Trello users who the board owner invites to collaborate on the board. They receive notifications about board activity and can be assigned to cards on the board.

Assigning a member to a card "subscribes" them to that card, meaning that they will see activity for things like comments on the card, due date changes, and when the card moves.

Finally, as part of the "stretch" specs in this goal, you may choose to implement the "teams" feature of Trello. In Trello, teams of members can be created, and teams can own boards.

Use the real Trello app and the mockups below to guide your design and development process.

### Setting Up Your Snapshot

1. Fork & clone the [Trossello repo][trossello]
1. Create and checkout a new branch for this goal, something like `members-and-teams`
  ```
  $ git checkout -b members-and-teams
  ```
1. Use `git reset --hard` to revert your local repo to the [starting commit][starting-commit]
  ```
  $ git reset --hard d177114b033eb950e6fdd4d620815b74b5f90eaa
  ```
1. Push your branch to the remote repo on GitHub
  ```
  $ git push -u origin members-and-teams
  ```
1. Get started on the specs!

### Mockups

Mimic the real Trello interfaces for members and teams as closely as possible.

Here are some example mockups that you can use as a reference. To be thorough, you will need to log in to Trello and explore the Members and Teams features yourself.

#### Add Members to a Board

This animation (from the Trello site) shows the basic workflow of adding a member to a board:

Note how typing auto-updates the search results of Trello users.

Here are some static mockups of the same workflow:

##### Members list

##### Member search

##### List of members

#### Add Members to a Card

There's no gif for adding members to a card :/ but here are some static mockups you can use. Also, make sure to try the feature out for yourself in Trello to see how it works.

##### Member search in card

##### Card shows members' avatars

##### Board shows members' avatars on assigned cards

## Context

[Trossello][] is a clone of the popular kanban software [Trello](https://trello.com/). It is built entirely by Learners Guild learners and staff.

A **snapshot goal** is meant to simulate the experience of developing a feature for an existing project.

You will have to orient yourself to the codebase, its idioms and architecture, and whichever tools you'll need to implement the feature. This involves reading a lot of code. To succeed, you'll need to figure out how the code works first before you begin to add to it.

As a professional web developer, you will rarely be building a project from the ground up, touching only code that _you_ have written. More often than not, you'll be contributing to a large, shared codebase with lots of legacy code. Not everything will make sense. You can't just start writing code any way you want - you have to learn how to integrate with the existing code.

_If you've never done a snapshot goal before_, this one may not be the best place to start as it is significantly challenge. You may want to try a slightly easier one first, like the [Trossello Snapshot - Labels Epic][labels-epic].
