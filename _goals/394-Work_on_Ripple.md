## Description

Ripple is an open-source rapid response tool allows an organization to ask their supporters to send an SMS message to a specific number in order to capture their info and engage them moving forward.

## Context

This is not a drill. This the real tamale.

If you choose this goal, you'll be working for an external client (i.e. not someone within Learners Guild) on a live, in-production codebase.

Only choose this goal if you are ready and willing to commit to multiple weeks of work in a new codebase with less support available. Because the technology is not managed by Learners Guild, there is no guarantee that coaches will be able to support you. You will likely need to figure out a lot of things on your own.

This is a great goal for testing your skills in a "live" remote development environment. It will be fun. It will not be easy.
